"Nerve"...

Chen...Chen Surprise

Pay attention to ******ciation

Crazy ****ents, I play "Birds of a Feather".

Can you please be more energetic?

My fri***, the funeral atmos***** is ***eady so strong

How do you make me have dynamism?

Fighting...figh****

***tern Music Folk Music Bat***

Go help!

Watch me kill him today

What's going on?

The kid who plays the cello was looking for somet**** to do last week.

Friends who study folk music met your teac*** today

Says

The nation is the world's...

Go back

Then "Birds of a Feather" went

Nervousness, saliva wipe it

It's all plucked

Do you want ***ple to ****tice the piano?

I will kill you ***ieve it or not?

Nerve You are ****ssed with the feelings of Master Wang Wen

Try to let go

Put it down? Where to put it?

In the bank? As interest?

In the years we have been enrolled

Have you ever had a love scandal between ***tern and folk music?

None of them.

***ause the Western music ***cks of our dirt, our folk music smacks of their ***thes

We and they are Romeo and Juliet

the two are incompatible

A mere iron fence can stop my love?

And what makes a fight together?

We all contribute blood and sweat

In the end only we were isolated

That's racist, huh?

Teacher, I'll help Chen Jing carry the water, she can't carry it alone.

Why does it smell like meat?

He sme*** like this, probably with the oil of fried pork skin bath

No food in the piano room

Good

You know how to check our folk music room

***ays think we are not doing the right thing

The piano room of Western music he never ***cked

You are so heartless and lungless

The ***ght ***uld be very light, right?

Do not block the window...

Why don't you have some too?

Senior vio*** major Sun Xiao

Auditioned for the Curtis ****itute of Music

Sun Xiao is creating her own brilliant fut*** on the road of music.

But some ****ents spend their days in a state of lethargy

I would like to name two stud**** for criti****

Chen Jing, a sophomore yangqin major

and sophomore ethnic *****ssion major Li Yu

These two students are in the piano room where they sho*** be *****icing hard.

Use of water dispensers for hot pot

Not only did you mis*** sch*** property, you disregarded sch*** discipline.

****king water fountain shabu-shabu?

I'll post a strategy in my ***cle of frie*** later

Awesome!

Students of Folk Music

This week, our symp**** orchestra is perf***ing at Zhongshan Conc*** Hall.

Mr. Wang Wen, who plays the piano, needs a music turner.

None of us have the time

Do you folk musicians want to come and help?

Lunch box ah

Is it great to have a box lunch?

Moving tiles a morning is also good ***ens of it

What makes you think that our folk musicians will go?

I'll go. - What day? What time? What to wear?

Sorry... - Watch it.

Sorry...

What is she doing here with a folk musician?

Turning the score

I have to tune the stri*** properly later

If she doesn't open her mouth, I'm afraid she'll take me out of tune.

Can I sit here?

My piano is valuable

It is expen**** I expensive ah?

It is expensive

Now for the Prokofiev Piano ****erto No. 2

Piano Performance Wang Wen

Turning the score

Goodbye ***ther

Master Wang Wen

Hello

What is it?

I like you

What's your name again?

My name is Chen Jing, class of 2011, I am your sister.

My sister?

What do you study? I'm a yangqin student.

Is the yangqin considered a ***ical *****ument?

What?

The yangqin is of course

I'm going abr*** next year

Foreign scho*** still have to look at my conduct score

I have no grudge agai*** you, you do not mess with me

***ther Teacher

The car is ***ving, let's go.

***ther, do you have a mood adjustment in the second ****ment today?

You hear it?

Turning the score

Why aren't you leaving yet? The car is leaving soon.

Yankee

Yangqin is a traditional Chin*** stri**** instr*****

*****duced to China from Per*** during the Ming Dynasty

Same family as piano

The same family

We are ****ally brot**** and sisters in the same discipline ah

You've been chattering all afternoon.

I still have to practice the piano

Give me a cigarette.

I'm emotionally frust***** I want to learn bad

A music student does not even know the yangqin

And laugh at me? Calling me rustic?

It's so unfair.

Oil dregs Any inspirational songs? Play me two songs

Which one do you want?

The kind that gets me on my feet

***get the past, for*** the shame.

To be a new per*** with wou***

Oil residue

I get it.

Get out of the way

I want to be on stage

I want Sensei to remember what the yangqin is all about

You're joining the sch*** folk band?

Did you not come to the depar***** ***ting this week?

That's where people come to take care of their ears at home.

The sch*** folk band has been disbanded

What's the point of being in a band?

But even if they don't disband

The qual*** of our folk orchestra is also too sorry for the ances****

Not to ment*** the conc*** hall

***are dance can not find their accompaniment

How about we form a band?

***xing a few students to come in

One more year of college entr**** exams

If you don't make up for it now, what university will you be able to get into with your total score?

This is the *****rmance schedule of my part-time job this month

Not I boast rea*** busy than 18 line star***

You earn a ***tle less, we are young, my friend.

Think about the ***ure now

It's impossible to live in the moment, believe me.

Chen Jing, you're a famous ***yer in our depar*****.

I can't even believe the *****uation in what you're say***.

I didn't say you ***rned that thing funny yet

You...

I want to set sail for the ***tle

But there is no partner

You still have me.

A drummer and a yangqin ***yer

What kind of combination are you and I like this?

No soul

In fact, there is one last trick

Says

I'm not taking any cult**** lessons, and I'm not working part-time.

Have you forgotten about that dormi****?

Dormitory 502

All are learning folk music ah

They are folk music students

But I think they are not human ah

I can only send you here, my friend.

Although they are my sisters, but I...

Don't be afraid. They're just a lit*** bit fancier.

Bin*** ****ents only

What is the ****ndary ah?

Binary yuan professional point is ACG

Anima**** Comics Games

They are only interested in these ***ngs, but not in the others.

How do you know so much about it?

Miscell****** knowledge

I'll copy from the left.

I'll break the back

Yes, it's on...

That...

Her name is Sakura, and she hates to talk.

You guys don't hate talk***, do you?

Talking can help you lose ***ght

Sitting and talking for an hour can burn 33.5 calories, said

My name is Chen Jing, I am one year older than you, and I study yangqin.

You call...

I'm babe sauce

I'm Tartar Sauce

I have only eaten strawberry jam and peanut ***ter

What do you want from us?

Do you want to participate in...

You...

Do you want to go out ***ough the door or through the window?

In short, if they ***ect you, the last resort is two words

Handicraft

Moving on

If you would like to join

I'll buy each of you an original fig*** that you want

Plus one year's internet fee

Moving on

That's not enough, is it?

One handicap per week?

Welcome, my partner.

Let's put the phone away for a while

Let's have a human-to-human ex***nge

What's this guy doing?

My name is Li Yu, in ***rge of *****ssion

My Secretary

Let's start by coming up with a band name, shall we?

I ***yed up late last night thin**** about two

First

Magic Sound Heavenly Band

Is there a stra**** through eff***?

Nothing

Goddess of Folk Music...

Big Band

How is it? A combination of East and West

kill both young and old

What about me?

What are your instructions?

-2.5 Subdivision -What the hell?

A few of us are elites from the 2nd ****nsion

You and this buddy are ******enting the 3rd ****nsion

Ordi**** human beings - so our union

It is 2.5 times

Then why not call it the Yin-Yang junction?

Don't go...

*****nious society, everything has to talk about it

2.5 Subdivision

Pretty good...

Anyway...

This week's handbag ****hase link has been sent to you ah

No prob***

But you stayed up late last night thinking about the name

You don't have any time to think about where we should ****arse?

Teacher...I'm begging you

You see how sinc*** I am

It's ***less to tell me anyt****. Go to the department and write a note.

If you have IOUs, you have a ****arsal hall.

We ***lly need the rehearsal hall

You don't have a gig. What do you need it for?

We want to form a band. - A band to work?

No. - All right.

You should review, review, review, and take reme**** courses.

Get ready for the full-scale entrance exams

Don't delay any longer

Teacher, we are not dela****.

We are creating the future!

Look on the bright side!

I think it is easier to practice songs in nat*** to achieve the ***ect of unity in the sky

Then let's think about the main song

Who let you take this place?

This is our territory

Who did you say hello to?

This place must also open a strip ah?

I'll try again

How about it?

Every night after the Western music rehearsal at 9pm

Master is willing to give us an hour to rehearse secr****

Anyway, the ***chers in the department were gone at that time

Yes, young man, how did you do it?

It's just a sincere communication

No...but I have a request for you

I'll report back to you later

That...

You prom***d 502 dormitory one handicraft per week?

You're a rich kid, huh?

I know my *****rament has always confused you in this regard, but I'm not.

Do you know how expensive a handicraft?

How expensive can it be? Not just a doll

I often catch a lot of them at the temple fair.

Didn't I send you the purchase link?

Please open your eyes and take a look

It's not too late to regret it.

They took away my student ID card.

Said if I broke my promise, I'd put up a lost and found poster.

Said he found my student ID card in the men's room

If I am correct

This should be your sta*** food for the rest of your life

It's eerie.

So scary

***ies and gentlemen, we only have one hour of your precious time.

So ***hout ***ther ado, let's get excited!

Then let's choose a tune. I have a suggestion.

There is a famous song of Yangqin ***led "***eral's Order

Especially handsome I *****ially want our band to play

Never played it.

You can learn if you don't know

I learn a new tune for at least two weeks

I can't afford to wait

There are not many folk music ensemble pie***

There are even fewer modern ones, and no one wants to write folk music.

How about "Chinese New Year Overture"?

It's too vulgar, right?

Ever**** will come *****iately

Cheaper

Dear Artists

Pre-agreed

One hour, you practice 40 minutes.

Leave 20 minutes for me to sing with me

Then...

I won't push back

"A few of us are not playing

It's a rush of soldiers in the music

Beheading the long whale and winning the battle agai*** the barbarian thorn"

How can someone write such ***ngs in a diary?

Yes, you are ind*** not playing.

You are singing in the *****round

And...

What else? "April 2, light rain

But I can't help but be anno*** by the ***ing and snuggle up to people and sing"

It can be said that it is very disgusting

What's so funny? Add me to it?

What do you want?

I think...

Talking sense

You...

We are all young people have somet**** we want to cherish

Is this funny?

Only she wrote it down in her diary

You put it in the case

Since you can make jokes without saying hello

Then I will also take your cherished

Playing aro*** with it?

Apologize to her

Violence ***inst violence is not right

But...

I will teach you well today

What is the ritual...

Sorry

Sorry

Sakura-chan

Are you okay?

Is this what she's ***ome ***ause of these people?

You artists are too ***lte

In the future, this kind of front-line work to kill the enemy

Please give me the ******zation

Whose ring is this?

Lord ****sand Fing*** You're Lord ****sand ***gers?

I also offer my knees

Lord Thousand Fingers I have ***ired you for a long time ah

I didn't think it was you!

I have a message for each of your vid***

What message was left?

Say it

Flat-chested bad reviews

Don't you kneel?

We already know that. - ****times we even help her with the accompaniment.

I want to join too

I want to join too

Let's change it to an ensemble piece and play it together.

Do you know the name of that song just now?

This is an old-fashioned song

Do you know what the ***ient style is?

How many points did you get on your midterm ***tory exam?

66 points

Not only did it pass, but it was particularly auspicious.

You have no idea what we are really doing

It's just playing the piano

I'm not that bad of a professional, I can keep up with your hand speed.

Haze played these old-fashioned songs well

Read the General History of China several times

Her history ***res are superb

Even the general high ***ool students can not comp***

Bebe and I have also been working very hard to learn the ancient lang****

I hope that one day I can put the most powerful words to Haze's songs.

Sakura-chan has also been ****ying the origin of national musical instru*****

From Xia, Shang and Zhou to Modern Times

There is almost no evolu**** of the instrument she does not know

We like folk music like secon**** yuan

Like the ancient style songs

These are the things I care about

You don't know anything. I won't let you in.

Lord Thousand Fingers I understand, I understand ah

I have been living in the secondary world

I'm just *****rassed to admit that my history score is over 90.

I read "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" four times

The song just now is "Power to the World

***ics divi*** into ***ing and autumn version Three Kingdoms version

Recently there is also a tomb rai*** version I know ah

I'm a history nerd!

So now I can join?

You traitor.

You...

It's too ugly

Don't you know yourself?

In the secondary world - only face is justice!

(Showdown)

Did they later break into Hyrule Castle?

Late sout**** mountain flow*** bloom, mossy fence

Spring ***wers bloom in the mountains every year

The grass on the ground is free and the willows are ***ing

The grass grows on the stranger every year

I ***ally waited for spr*** to come

Spring is coming, the grass is green

I finally waited for the flowers to bloom

The flowers are blooming and the flowers are red

a beautiful woman

The water flowing like water years

Ancient style song "Strange inch grass

Adapted from the Peony Pavilion's "A Dream in the Gar***

Is that right? That's right, isn't it?

I can even keep up with this

Can you send me a membership card?

You're out of tune.

The water flowing like water years

Hugg*** that hug Hugging that moon she laughed and bent her back

Hug that hug and carry that sister to the ****nquin

Hug that hug and carry that sister to the palan****

It's too much!

Just like to sing

No chance when you are young

Thank you artists Thank you so much!

Look at what you say, you are happy

Unforgettable ***ight

What an unforgettable night!

That...

Next week a comic book convention inv***d me to perform

Great We must go to the show

Do you need help?

Now we have a band, don't we?

How about going together?

Lord Thousand Fingers, what did you say? I'm a lit*** blind. I didn't hear you.

Do not want to forget it, I did not say

Comic-Con ah ... we are going to play at Comic-Con!

What is Comic-Con again?

Here we are

Hi

Let's go...hurry up

You two are really a good-looking couple

You can go stra**** to the wedding photo shoot it

Didn't you say you were going to be on stage?

The two of us specifically with the folk band to borrow the perfor***** clothes ah

In fact, I know it's not a good idea to wear

All were surprised by Chen...

Seven-colored island *****unded by sunshine

The most natural smile

Long hair flowing good mood

Be a free bird

Running side by side with open arms

The wind dances on the face

From now on, dreams shine

Youth is offic***** declared

Thank you for appla***** and cheering me on

Thank you for giv*** me a heartbeat and ***ing

Thank you for being on my side

No giving up No reservation

You are my most precious friend

Just when I needed love the most

Touch the fingers and make a promise later

Keep going together

SING...

LOVE...

SING...

Thank you SING for your wonde**** performance!

The follo**** *****rmers are the 2.5 Dimensional Ensemble

The guzheng player is the famous ancient style mas*** on B

Lord Thousand Fingers

Folk music, huh?

Please.

What are they ***ring?

I don't understand Is it playing the May Fou*** Youth?

Why do you want to listen to this kind of stuff at Comic-Con?

Let's get our SING back!

When I listen to folk music, I want to burn incense and wors***

Wait a minute.

Not really, right?

There is a lit*** fresh meat ah

Lord Thousand Fingers...give me an autograph...

I have to ask, what did you just play?

I want to learn. - I want to learn too.

I play the yangqin

Chen was shocked Oh my God, it was great!

Come and see. - What?

She is so good

Turn the book to page 36.

The Storm

"Don't listen to the sound of beat*** leaves through the for***

Why not whistle and walk slowly"

These are the key words, remember them.

"A straw rain and smoke to let the life of the world, and the spr*** wind blowing wine awake"

Oil dregs. - What for?

I'm going to ride it out.

You should not be too impulsive ah

You'll see.

I have asked Bebe Tata for advice on the ****ssary skills in the girl's ***ics

You ask them if they can...

Is it reliable?

They read the cartoon but the sweet and silly kind of sweet ah

Anyone who stud*** folk music? Brother, your love is boundless!

I'm going to practice.

Go

Master Wang Wen

Hurry up and take a picture!

So beautiful. - So beautiful.

She's gone crazy again. - Yeah, right.

You guys are crazy!

This folk music is confessing ah

That's right.

Brother Teacher

I really like you

The last time you asked me a question, I've proved it to you.

Do you have anything else to ask?

If not

Can you just... - I have.

I have questions

The problem is that I don't like you

You want to fall in love early, I want to go abroad

We have no grudges and no enem***

Don't hurt me, okay?

What's all this?

Even if you are studying folk music, you can not be so corny

What happened to those who study folk music?

Get out of here and don't make me say anything worse.

I am not like you

So bottomless

What do you mean by that?

What's wrong with learning folk music?

My sister dares to love and hate

You are afraid of delaying your future.

Pretty proud of yourself, huh?

You say you're elegant all the time and you bully a little girl like that?

Don't go too far.

You guys are the ones who study folk music too badly, right?

Do not practice the piano well, but know how to get these evil ways

Shut up, everyone!

Get a weapon. Do it.

Prote***** Sister - Prote***** Sister

Afraid of you can not ***port the teacher

Are you happy now?

Don't come over

-What's in this? -Turpentine.

For cleaning the piano

Get out of the way...

Wang Wen Do you know what a yangqin is?

Yangqin was introduced to China from ***sia in the Ming Dynasty

Same family as piano

The first piano was inve**** in Germany in 1709

But the yangqin has existed in China for over 400 years today.

What makes you ***pise her after 400 years?

The sound of folk music Have you heard it?

Do you know the history?

If it's not great

What's wrong with us studying for so many years?

When you go abroad

Do not want to tell forei***** that our own music is also superb

Come to your place and learn your music

Just because I like it

Wouldn't it be cooler to tell them that?

When you think back to 17 years old later

Definitely more regre**** than us

Thank you all for this time

No more practice in the future?

No more practice

Now that Sensei knows what a yangqin is, he also rejected me cleanly.

I am now also satisfied with

You are really easy to be satisfied

My greatest ****ngth is contentment

Special ******tanding See good and take it

Who praised you?

Don't you feel sorry?

We have had a hard time getting along so well

We can still play together and play somet**** else

Forget about this band

These handic***** are also too expensive

I want to call to complain

What if we don't want hand-me-downs?

Then what do you want?

I set up a band for the teacher brother you into the band is for the handbag

Both of them are gone, so what are they doing together?

I like the guzheng!

We like the instru***** we've learned too.

If you don't like the yangqin

After all these years, why do you learn it?

My mother asked me to learn, so I learned

I am such a random bea*** girl ah

What about you?

Want to quit too?

I...

That...

I've been meaning to tell you...

My family plans to let me go abroad

Traitor

That's right.

Traitor

I call you a traitor. - I...

Is it that bad? It's that serious.

You just think everything is too easy

Others look down on folk music

You despise yourself

A taste of fresh is satisfied

Live so casually

What do you think life is? A trial product?

That's right.

I am such a person

I don't know why I like it, but I like that shitty person for so long

I don't know why I learned the yangqin

It is silly to practice so many years

There are people like me in this world.

Then go play with people like you

Even if I like folk music, what can I do?

Rely on a few of us to start the epoch?

It's too sad to fight when you know you're going to fail, isn't it?

The words of the chicken blood, open mouth

You really read too many comics, right?

Nerve. - Go away.

You traitor.

Sakura, what are you going to do in college?

Still learning the erhu? No way!

That stuff can not be eaten as food in the future ah

Okay ... let's not get angry with her, let's watch TV

Sorry I'm late again.

You've been late since you had a boyfriend? What's going on?

Bebe, why are you still dressed like this now?

Think you're 13 years old?

What do you look like?

Children like this, we go along with her can not be?

It's all your fault

Let's go!

One more time

Successfully pass the exam...

How can I pass the exam successfully?

Two eyes open Start competing...

A year of hard work, a lifetime of happiness...

Okay, with such enthusiasm

We turn to our textbooks

Shit, I'm scared to death. Mom has ***ned off...

I don't want to learn yangqin

Mom, I said I don't want to learn the yangqin anymore.

You give me some reaction. - I know.

What reaction do you want? Happy or angry?

Didn't you ask me to learn the yangqin?

I made you learn. - Who said that? My father.

Your father? Yes.

That day he was in pain...

Nervous ****rder

What's the name? Which one of you two is having the baby?

Together... - I'm dying if I don't come out.

You can't die.

We must be born

exert all your strength

This...

Harder...

What's wrong with you? You sing so badly.

Make it hard...

Make it hard...

exert all your strength

She's out.

You don't want to learn yangqin, you don't say

Why?

***ause it guided you into the world

Stayed with you for 11 years

This is the fate of your past life and its pres*** life

Now you don't want it.

But it also has feelings for you

You discuss it with it if it agrees, you do not need to talk to Mom

Mom has no problem with it.

Turning my back to the stars I don't want to make a wish again

Surrounded by a cloak

I have my flight

I want to be proud of the real me

Even if I can only cross

Dreaming of your piece of sky

Sparkling with Love

Not to suspect anything

Restart

What's a regret?

What do I get out of life in the end?

I sang and sang, youth is like a song

It's the beginning of sch***!

Everyone take their hearts back

I inform two things

One This year, the ****stry of Educa**** organized a popular ***cert for ****dren in mid-autumn

I hope that the students of the Western Music ***ool Band

Take advantage of the *****tunity to make the school proud

There is one more thing that the university depart***** have discussed.

It has been ***ided to suspend the enrol***** of students in Minh Le High School from next year

This ****sion is also based on the attitude of responsibility for students

So I hope that all the students who are ****ently enrolled in the folk music program of the secondary school

Cherish the learning ******unities you have now

If no one learns, no one will be recr***ed?

The school does not recruit

Wouldn't there be even less people to learn?

Isn't this a dead end?

This student, you sit down first

Maybe three or five years from now

There is no one who studies folk music

Low popularity of folk music No ***lity to prom***

Is this a problem that can be solved by schools?

This student, would you sit down first? Yes.

Then I'll sign up for this semester's popular concert for children.

No one to promote I will promote

The concert is to participate in the band does not acc*** *****idual performances

You sit down

We have a band. - You have a band?

Where is your band?

Here it is. - Here it is.

You're not a band, okay?

At most, it's a theater group, right?

Everybody sit down.

***ort to the teacher We have a band

So now we're ready for the show, right?

Participating in the show is representing the honor of the school

The symp**** orchestra has been training without interruption

Is your impro***** band capable of participating together?

If something goes wrong, who is responsible?

Is the collective honor for you to just discredit?

Dismi**** of the meeting

Don't even think about the fact that you are representing the school after all

-Why are we being held back? -You shut up.

Tolerate you for so many years

Are you still in charge of whether our folk music can be on stage or not?

How to talk? You bunch of wildcats

Who is the wild card?

We are learning from our authentic ancestors

You who learn Western music

Why not also recognize a fore*** father?

Calm down, everyone. Calm down.

You'll be punished for figh**** here.

Why are you dragging our future down with you?

Go

Ladies and ****lemen

Don't you despise folk music?

Always fighting is not the way

Dare you pick up an instrument and compete with us for once?

How dare you fight with the piano?

We could have just sent someone to wipe you out, okay?

Your bre*** is so bad, you haven't brushed your teeth for a few days?

Do you know what it means to make a fool of yourself?

After that, you'll understand. - Okay.

Compare

When you lose, you have to admit that music is a class.

If you lose, you will collec****** go to the flyover to sell art

We follow the whole ***cess with cell phones

Do you dare? Sure.

lit. if you agree to bet, you must accept to lose

But if you lose, will it be the same?

Come on, how could we possibly lose?

Don't be afraid to come when the time comes

How can you not come?

In the future, if you want to see these instruments, you may have to go to the museum.

A war letter? How interesting.

You're making a fool of yourself!

They are crazy, right?

The dog is ***ping over the wall, right? What should I do?

We don't have to die with them, do we?

"Let my music be a war cry."

That's what Chopin said.

This is our piano room building

This is the time of the year when students are practicing more intensely.

In terms of discipline, we are very strict.

Absolutely no fighting in the piano room.

The atmos***** of art is very strong ah

It is...

This is...

Over the door is the folk music practice area

To make sure they don't interfere with each other

That's what it means

In fact, these two districts are the same

There's no difference. We won't go there.

Check out the Western music sect*** again?

Good

Is this...a show for us?

Yes...nice...

Go back to the piano room.

No one is coming

I knew they had less guts than flea shit.

What to do?

Wait a little longer. Someone will be able to resist.

Does this student have something to say?

Children who learn music are a little different

This may be the practice of the fire into the magic

Very good. Very innovative.

A combination of East and West

So what's the point of getting this?

It's not working

How can music interfere with each other? Right?

For...

Take it down

A good temple of art

Why do you make it look like a jail cell? It's...tearing down...

Inspection of the school's reput*****

You guys are just going to mess around?

One ver*** warning for all

Folk music majors

I know you want to take this opportunity to prove *****elves

But school is not your playground

There are ideas to achieve through legit***** means

Dismissal of the meeting

Dear Artists

We...

When is the ***lic performance at Tianqiao?

But it was indeed a good fight

It's an even match. - Yes.

All of you are our *****ctable oppon****

So actually you have another ***ice

Does anyone hear it?

We now have an instrument miss*** from the establishment?

***mes Missing Chimes

I can't think of a solution for the moment.

The percussion group... carry those lines in the back.

The effect may be a little worse, but it's better than nothing.

Sorry, artists.

I was here to listen to the fun

But I heard you say there is something missing

I just couldn't resist

This set of clocks was made more than 20 years ago when the Citizens' Orche**** was disbanded.

Inbound

Always put with here, no one has moved

This is put aside, so no one will remember it

Can you still get it to ring?

Well...

Oil drippings, some tofu

Put down some greens

You help a little

I have no hands

Lord Thousand Fingers is ***ling me!

Lord Thousand Fingers is calling me!

Master, look at this. - I want this.

It's beautiful. - This one.

Look at this. - I want the feathers. I want the hem.

Then let's buy it together

A wonderful musical feast is about to begin

Today, I believe that all the children present will be able to experience the charm of music up close and personal.

I also believe that maybe this group of kids will be on this stage in the future.

Continue to pass on the beautiful melo****

Shiny Shiny Shiny Shiny

No idea

Those are tiny firef****.

Fly to the west to fly to the east

Mom, look, they're wearing strange clothes.

You can't do this later.

All of you are our respectable opponents

It was indeed a good battle, evenly matched.

Actually you have another cho***

Do...do us a favor

Come on...give me all the passes!

Here you go. - Take it.

Hold it.

I'll leave it to you.

Go

Here's what we have for this performance ***ight

Last piece Moz*** Piano Concerto No. 27

We would like to invite the affiliated high school of Zhongxia ****onal Music Academy

Youth Symphony ****estra students

Principal Piano Wang Wen Principal Vio*** Zheng Youen

Coming

Quick

Who are you?

There are also eggs

There is no such thing in the program

Brother, it's ready inside.

What's the situation? This is not the same group of people

Go for it!

Watch this.

Let me do it. - Okay.

Oil residue

How much did you receive from the *****itoes for bringing me here?

Recently, I heard that there are many fireflies in this park at night.

I like a lot of things I also like big stars

Why don't you take me to the house of someone in their family?

Why do you like fireflies?

Beca*** the fireflies will light up

The head of the department will also light up ah

Because fireflies are cool

Do you have one?

Fireflies are so weak

It should be concealed.

But they just want to shine

So I am the fire***

Nuts!

I read that

The light on the butt of the firefly is for courtship

Do you have some kind of misunderstanding?

The surrounding area is too cloudy, and there are no fireflies.

The ghost fire should float up

I'll go first, you keep it.

I want to talk to you

Say it

What's wrong? Constipation in the throat?

Where's your phone?

Open your circle of friends

Look ****fully at your circle of friends

What's going on? It's all selfies

Like to take a selfie because I am confi**** enough to be open and honest

This is me. This is what I look like.

Why do you send me so many weibo?

In my eyes, you look like this

Why don't you say something?

Send me the original film

Why don't you save it?

Forget it, I'm not saving it.

After you give me a new photo it

Let's go.

I didn't expect to be too late this year

I ***ted to see the fireflies with you once

There is no such thing as too late?

We have many, many more summers ahead of us

Don't be too...too fast, right?

You see

Ready to go?

Bye-bye. - Bye-bye.

Sorry, Lord Thousand Fingers.

I can't pin it up.

Once again

Just me...

A person...
