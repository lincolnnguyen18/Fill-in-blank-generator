South Korea ***urned to first place in the lat*** Bloomberg Innov***** Index, while the U.S. ***pped out of a top 10 that feat**** a cluster of ****pean count****.

Korea regained the crown from Germany, which ***pped to fourth place. The Asian ***ion has now ***ped the index for seven of the nine years that it’s been published. Singapore and *****erland each moved up one spot to rank second and third.

The Bloomberg index analyzes dozens of criteria using seven ***ally ****hted ***rics, ****uding rese**** and development spending, manufacturing capab***** and concentration of high-tech pub*** ****anies.

The 2021 rank**** reflect a world where the fight ***inst Covid-19 has ***ught innov***** to the fore –- from government effo*** to contain the pand****, to the digi*** *******ructure that’s allowed economies to work through it, and the race to develop vaccines that can end it.

“In the year of Covid and fac*** the urgency of climate change, the importance of *****ation fundam****** only increases,” said ****erine Mann, global chief econo**** at Citigroup Inc. “Innovation is often measured by new ideas, new prod**** and new services,” she said, but it’s their “diffusion and adoption” that is the real metric of success.

Wuhan Breakthrough
Much of the Bloomberg data comes from bef*** the virus crisis. Still, it’s notable that many countries high on the index –- like Korea, Germany and Israel –- have been world lea***s in some areas of figh**** the pandemic, ***ther it’s contact-tracing or speedy vaccination.

American names like Zoom Video *******cations Inc. or vaccine-maker Pfizer Inc. are among the past year’s emblems of innovation, refle***** the U.S.’s top rank*** for density of high-tech firms.

The pandemic has also spotli***** a different kind of ******hrough, one that has more to do with policy and organization than technology or research, according to Nobel prizew****** ****omist Paul Romer.

“We should ****gnize that the avail**** metr*** miss impor**** *****sions of innovation,” said Romer, a ****essor at New York *****rsity’s Stern School of Business. “Officials in Wuhan showed for the first time that in a couple of weeks, it is feasible to test 10 ***lion residents of a city for coronavirus. This was a very important public hea*** innovation.”

‘Have a Future’
Korea’s return to the top spot is ***nly due to an increase in patent activity, where it ranks top, alongside a str*** performance in R&D and manufacturing.

There’s near-total agreement in South Korea that “R&D is essential to have a future,” said Lee Kyung-mook, a ****essor of busi**** *****ement at Seoul ****onal University. “It’s sandw***** between more devel**** nations, which still outpe***** them in technology, and China that is catching up fast relying on lower labor costs.”

Second-placed Singapore, which has been *****ating bud*** funds to help ***kers and companies transition to a digital economy, also sco*** high for manufacturing –- and its ****ally *****titive universities put it top of the tertiary education gauge. Switzerland, a ***der in financial and *****gical technology, ranks near the top in both of the index’s research categories.

Germany’s loss of the crown ***lows a warning two years ago by Juergen Michels, chief econo**** of Bayerische Landesbank, who said the ***ntry lac*** skilled work*** and a proper strategy for next-generation technology.

As the two bigg*** economies, the U.S. and China account for much of the world’s innovation, and they’re also ***ked in a bat*** over key areas of policy like intell****** property rights. The gap between them has stea**** decl**** over the liftetime of the index. This year, both saw their rankings decline.

‘Will Take Time’
The U.S., which top*** the first Bloomberg Innovation Index in 2013, dropped two places to 11th. In a report last year, the National Science Board found that “where once the U.S. was the uncontested leader in ***ence and engineering, we are now ***ying a less dominant role.”

The country scores badly in higher education, even ***ugh U.S. universities are world-famous. That underperformance was likely made worse by obstacles to ***eign students, who are ***ally promi**** in science and technology clas*** -- first due to the Trump administration’s visa policies, and later to the pandemic.

New Presi**** Joe Biden ran on a ***mise to reinvigorate U.S. manufacturing with a $300 billion investment in R&D and breakthrough technologies, a policy he labe*** “Innovate in America.”

Sung Won Sohn, an economist at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, says the U.S. is still in the vanguard –- but ****days its innovations tend to come from smaller companies, and take ***ger to reach the consumer. “There are a lot of new ideas from many start-ups,” he said. “It will take time for the ideas to be *****lated into marketable products.”

China, which fell one place to 16th in the 2021 index, is locked in a battle with the U.S. over key aspects of innovation policy.
