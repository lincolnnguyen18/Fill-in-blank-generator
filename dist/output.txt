prologue
Audit *****tment of the Associ***** of Retributionists.
It was a spec*** *****tment ***hin the ******zation cal*** the *****iation of Demono******s that prot***s peo*** from ****itual disa****s, and is fea*** by demono******s.
After all, their main duty is to ***itor and super**** the ****itualists in the country, *****ially the dem*** who bel*** to the *****iation.
Those who mis*** the abili**** they have been given, those who are in ***tact with spiri**** ****riors or crim**** organiz****** that abuse peo***, and those who use their abili**** in uneth**** ways... We crack down on all kinds of misuse of spi***ual power, and in some cases we deal with the misuse ***ore the world knows about it.
In other words, it is a self-cleansing ******zation that ***tects the order and image of the Retribution Society.
Beca*** of its ****tion as a self-cleansing ******zation, the *****tment is also cons****ed impor**** in the organization's ****rnal politics, and there is alw*** a cert*** percentage of blood relatives of the "Nine Old Families" that have a *****ndous ****uence on the ****nese *****ology ****stry.
***ause of this back***und, the ***bers of the Audit Depar***** are generally hig*** ***lled and are ***red by many ***ons.
"Exc*** me, ***ter.
A pile of pap*** that ***ked like they were about to fall down. The dirty walls and ceiling.
The floor was littered with spell tools labe*** "Evidence" and "Seized", ***ing off an air of misery.
The per*** who ***pped into the off*** of the head of the audi**** depar***** was a side-tailed girl with a winn*** air. She was about fift*** or sixteen years old. She was about fifteen or sixteen years old, an age at which she would nor***ly have been ***ined at a trai**** sch***, but on her chest was a shin*** badge that ****cated that she was an offi**** mem*** of the Audit *****tment.
"Oh, you're here. I told you to call me "sir" in here.
It was the *****lucent woman, the owner of the room, who gree*** the girl's entry with a lang*** voice.
I'm sorry. I'm still ***ting used to it. ……So, what is it that you want me to do?
"Oh, that's the thing, ***ugh.
The head of the ****ting *****tment, whose eyes loo*** like dead fish in cont**** to the girl who was full of life, waved his finger. Then, seve*** she*** of copy paper ***tly ***rged from the pile of pap*** and fell into the girl's hands.
"I need you to keep an eye on this guy.
"……Oh, no.
As soon as she loo*** down at the document prin*** with the pho*** and rough ****iles of the peo*** to be ***itored, the girl's face ***ame strained. The expre***** on her face was one of astonishment, ****usion, and even a hint of anger.
After clos*** observing such cha***s in the girl, the head of the audi**** *****tment ope*** his mouth to add more inform***** about the ***ject of survei******.
"You've heard a bit about it, haven't you? You've prob**** heard a lit*** bit about it. A team of stud**** from Pei Pei got rid of a spi*** class 6.
"……Yes.
Ghost A in Shinonome City, commonly known as the "milk-avoi**** woman.
It's a ghost of grade 6 that occu**** about a week ago.
It was a joke of a mons*** that ***ned into a ***eet mons*** due to a poor ***ast complex, but it was so ****erous that it wiped out a profes****** veteran team.
There was even a sense of sadness on the scene, ***dering how many ***ple would be killed ***ore the ***lve mas***s, the highest ****ngth posse**** by the *****iation of Demonologists, ***ived. The team that broke the ……deadlock was a team of unkn*** ****ents who hadn't even ****ived their tempo**** ***ense yet.
And the tar*** of this surveillance is the one who got rid of the spi*** class 6.
I'm not sure what the deta*** of the abil*** are, but I'm pre*** sure it's a power that can ***ove a spi*** level 6 with a ***gle blow, which would be painful even for us. I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but…… it's a good idea.
"I ……see. Does that mean that the rumor that made me doubt my ears was true?
The girl rai*** her eyebrows in deep dis****sure when she saw that the head of the ****ting *****tment was ****ually reluctant to say ****hing.
There was a contin****** to the story of the ***dent's exor**** of the spi*** class 6.
It is said that his ***lity to rem*** spir***, which had defe**** a ***rit class 6, was quite ques****able.
The girl even overheard that ***ing the exor****, the myste***** A in Shinonome City ***med to be cli***ing sex***ly.
Rumors have their own tails, so I'm not going to go into the ***max stuff, but I'm ***tty sure he used his perve**** pow*** to get rid of the ghost.
The fact that the Audit *****tment is work*** in this way is the best proof of that.
That's what I'm ***king about. And this time, my job is to keep an eye on the ***dent dem*** so that they don't abuse their ****ities and ruin the reput***** of the *****iation, but this guy smells a bit fishy.
What do you mean?
"Kuzunoha's ****lved.
I'm sorry…….
The girl's *****ssion ***ame even more disto**** when she heard the name of Kuzunoha, the head of the "Nine Old Families", the fam*** fam*** that cont***s the Japanese demono****** industry.
It is poss**** that Kuzunoha has been deliberately conce***** the abili**** of the surveillance tar***. It's a good idea to take a look at a few of the ***ngs that are avail**** on the market. I'm not sure what to do.
"That ……cert***ly sou*** *****cious. By all means, let me be the ***cher.
The girl tells the head of the audi**** depar***** with her ***eks drawn ****ther.
Feel*** a ***tle ******ortable with his forw*** stance, the audit mana*** ***cked with the girl, his subordinate and favo**** disciple.
"Are you sure about this?　You were recommended to me beca*** you would be less lik*** to be ***iced by the watc***s, but a ***cher is in a ****tion to apply for punis***** of the watcher, if necessary. Of cou***, you have to do it. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're ***king for.
No prob*** at all.
The girl asse**** with such force that she interr***** the audit ***ager.
He then ***bbed a document with a pict*** of the tar*** of his surveillance, Haruhisa Furuya, and grab*** it.
I hate Kuzunoha, and I hate the peo*** I'm *****oring!
He left the room quic***, prob**** to get ready for work.
"……I hope so.
The audit manager exhaled a sigh and thou*** to ***self.
'But is it an obscene abil*** to rem*** a ***rit class 6? ……It's not in the reco***, but no way.
Mutte**** to no one in particular, the head of the audi**** *****tment star*** on his next task.
●
It is the time of ***ting. Between day and night. On the roof of a ****ding *****ooking a crowded ***eet.
"Oh no, I guess I'm a ***tle late ***ing to check on you. The audit *****tment is ***eady on the move.
A girl was mutte**** to ***self *****tfully as she ***ked at the sky that was ****nning to turn night.
A worn out high ***ool unif***. White legs stret***** out from a short skirt. A ***ffed animal key chain ***ging from a desig***** bag.
She put her hands on her heart-painted che*** and pouted her lips in a gesture that had a certain air of mock*** to it.
However, she was so cute that the bruise didn't ***her her at all. She puf*** up her cheeks even ***ugh no one was ***king at her, and shook her legs, which she had ***own off the roof.
I don't know what to do. I'm not sure what to do, but…… I'm not sure I'm going to be able to do anyt**** about it.
As she said this, she ***ned her atten**** to the crowd far below.
"Now, let's see who dese**** to be ever****'s ****rite 'just***' ***ster.
She smi*** like an inno**** child, her eyes narr**** as if ****ching for prey, and she ***wed with a *****ciously ***uman light.
Chapter 1: The Crisis of Revocation of Pro***ional ***ense
　　　　　1
Tokyo Metropolitan Demon Acad***.
It's a ****ning institute for dem*** that was established to deal with the increasing num*** of ****itual disasters.
Among the ***eral ****ning institutes for ******logists in Japan, the quality of the stud**** is outstan****, and many of the ****uates have made a name for *****elves as top ******sionals.
However, it is not only graduates who are act*** in the field.
After completing the trai****, the ****ents form teams and go out into the field to hone their ski*** while ***ving the psyc*** pheno**** that avenge peo***.
At the end of the day, these ****ents are the ***den eggs of the ***ure of the demon industry, and at the same time, they are the chi*** of the heroes who will save peo*** from evil spi***s, ***sters and other spiri**** disasters.
It's been about two weeks since we ***ved the ……milk-****ding woman case. Most of the ****ions we've taken on have ended in failure, and we've bec*** the epitome of that.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
It's the early ****rnoon of the week after GW.
I, Haruhisa Furuya, Aoi Karasuma, and Misaki Soya were ***ding our heads in an empty class**** near the staff room. In particular, Soya's ****tiful face was ****orted and she was letting out an uncharac******** moan. Even her trademark ***bon see*** to be wilting.
Even Karasuma, who was alw*** cheer***** talk*** about women's bod***, had a ***uded *****ssion on his face as he said, "My ****tion is…… to get ahead in my career and ***ome ***ular.
The rea*** why this is happe**** is beca*** of a piece of paper on the desk.
Just a few minu*** ago, I was summoned to the staff room and han*** a ***ning letter in ***son.
The ******atious document, which began with the words, "Misaki Soya, Haruhisa Furuya, and Aoi Karasuma advise caution to the trai**** team," went on to say roughly the follo****.
He said, "Since the rate of miss*** accomplishment has been so low since the milk-avoi**** woman ****dent, if you ****inue to make more mist***s, I will ***oke your provis***** lice*** this month.
"I got my *****sional lice*** on my first ***essment!　If I don't do somet****, I'm going to be the shor**** ***son to have my provis***** ***ense confiscated!
Soya, who had been look*** down at his papers and ***ling *****helmed, stood up, banging his desk.　He stood up, tapping his desk.
I ***ught, "***nks to my provis***** lice***, I ***ally got the clue to the curse, so I'll keep this ***entum going and get my real lice*** too!　But…… then, how did this ***pen?
That's what it is. It's ***ause you've been tak*** on all kinds of weird cases at random.
I was ****king about a ***icy that Soya had prop**** about two weeks ago, when I had just ***ten my pro***ional lice***.
In the first place, the rea*** why Soya and I are aim*** for succ*** as dem*** is to lift the curse that has fal*** on me.
It's not just a curse eit***.
It's the worst curse of all, the most disreputable, the most despicable.
The name of the curse that Soya was ****tched by was the leche**** eye.
It's a hellish ***lity that all*** you to see and cont*** all kinds of sex*** inform*****, ****uding the sex*** habits and fantasies of the peo*** you see, the parts of the ****site sex you often look at, the num*** of ***ple you've exper*****d, and the ***ngs you *****rbate to.
And what dwells in my hands is a ***max expul****.
It is a curse that sho*** be ***led a disg**** to all generations, as it ****ibly makes the per***, ***ing or dead, who pokes the plea**** hole that has ***eared ****where on the body ***max, and also removes ***rits as if it were a ***ter of ***rse.
The seal my late fos*** fat*** gave me - a brac**** with a sil*** cross on it - usua*** keeps my ****ities under control, but with the ****orary ****tion of the incompre******** power to make even ****ganic ***ter cli*** and the stra*** voi***, I can't help but feel that the curse is ***ting worse.
But the trou*** was, this curse could not be ***ken even by the twelve masters, the most powe**** ***ons in the country.
Soya's ***ily is one of the "Nine Old Families" that exert treme***** ****uence on the demon hun*** industry, and he is the head of the fam*** known as the "Soya of Shikigami. No mat*** what Soya does, he can't break the curse of the ****erous eye and he can't control it. And even with my own ***max elimination, even with the power of my fos*** fat***, who is in the class of the twelve masters, I could only apply a comfo***** seal.
Of course, I had ****gned mys*** to the fact that I would be deal*** with this curse for the rest of my life, but ……Soya didn't give up. He went ahead and tea*** up with me and Karasuma, using (and abusing) the power of the demon eye.
Soya's idea was that if he rose thro*** the ranks as a demonologist, he would be able to ***ess the ****idential *****mation mana*** by the associ***** and would……super the*** that the Twe*** Devas were just stu*** and if he got the inform*****, he might be able to fig*** out how to break the curse.
So about two weeks ago, we obta**** our "provis***al license" as quasi-***ons, and were able to get some inform***** about curses.
However, the only *****mation I got was that "the lewd eye is one of the sex relics of the succ**** king" and that there are more than one sex relic ***ides the eye. The only inform***** I got was that the lewd eye is one of the ****ubus king's sex relics and that there are more than one of these sex relics.
In order to obtain more deta**** inform*****, Soya said, "I'm going to get a full license next time! Soya was very ***ited, but when he was about to ***eive a spec**** request, he came up with this "***icy".
"I'll try to *****itize weird requ****.
I thou***, "What the hell?" and asked him for details.
"Now you know that there are other ***ngs like my eyes and Mr. Furuya's hands, right?　If we can find them, we may be able to get the *****mation we need to break the curse ***ter than we can get ahead. And if it's anyt**** like our curse, there must be some kinky stuff going on ***und there!
Soya made a ****rful ****ement with a smug look on his face.
So I'm going to prioritize ****ests that involve weird and ***arre phenomena like that.　It's a policy that kills two birds with one stone.　It's a policy that kills two birds with one stone!
I was worr*** that even the requests we ****ived would…… be ****erted even ***ugh we were a perve**** team, but Soya was so confident that I acce**** many requests that fit his policy…….
"And this is the ***ult.
I put the rep*** card on my desk, which was given to me along with the ***ning letter.
There is a brief prin**** of the rec*** requests I've acc***ed and the ***ults of those requests. Most of the requests are ***ked with a red batten. The only *****ssful request was the one where I disco***** that the rea*** for the checkered dolls that grew hair under***** at night was a prank by ***ior high ***ool stud****. That was a real waste of time…….
"It's not my fault that your work keeps failing, it's my policy!
Soya, who was *****onted with his ***ort card, waved his hands in prot***.
The last time I saw a ****ting ghost peep*** at me, it was compl***** Aoi-chan's fault that the ghost esc***d!
"Oh, that was unavoidable!　The killer's ****ting ***rit was a man, so my *****aining ****nique couldn't be used, and then the only job I could do was to peek into the girls' bath!
Karasuma, ***nted at by Soya, began to make ********hensible ***uses.
What the hell is wrong with you, you ***vert?
I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm sure it's a good idea. 　I'm sure you're not the only one who has a ***blem with this.
Well, I'm at fault for that, but no mat*** ……how stu*** Karasuma is, you wouldn't exp*** him to be doing the same thing as an evil spi*** at work!　You ***uld be tak*** a bath ***tead of peeping at me!　You're a woman after all!
The most ****aling thing about peeping is the immor***** and the ***sualness of it.　If you go in together, it's no diffe**** from a nudist beach, and you'll soon get used to it!　You idiot!
You're the idiot!
Besides, as I said bef***, if we take a bath together, we'll get wet. That's, you know, bad ***ners, isn't it? Would you bathe in a pub*** ****room ***wing that you would get an erection?　You wouldn't, would you?
I feel like I'm going crazy talk*** to this guy…….
"Aoi-chan……, you still haven't ***lected ***ugh on your life, ……huh?
"Huh? !
Soya took an ****iece from his ***ket and corn**** Karasuma agai*** the wall.
Miss Misaki……'ll be able to find somet**** that works for you. I'm sorry.
Soya's ****iece was gently inserted into Karasuma's ear. It was the first time I'd ever seen a man shake his head like that. Soya's eyes were ***rced with a heart mark, indicating the pres**** of a ****erous eye.
If they are just ***ling beh***, they are still a *****sting team that goes ***inst pub*** order and morals. I rea*** want to give them a break. Well, I can't speak for any*** else but mys***.
"Ugh. I won*** if the rea*** I was able to get rid of the milk-avoiding woman was beca*** we just hap***ed to have a good match. If I don't, I'll be back to squ*** one. What sho***…… I do?
Soya mutte*** sadly as he gave Karasuma a merci**** spanking.
And so, it's been a ***tle over two weeks since the ****dent with the milk-avoiding woman.
There were no major incidents of the bre***-avoiding woman class, and no one got into ***uble ***ause the ****tence of the cli*** ****lsion was disc****ed.
****ough I was on the verge of hav*** my pro***ional license ***oked, the days ***und me ****inued to be ***her peac****.
The ***ors that had been ****ading aro*** the ***ool - that Haruhisa Furuya had been sexu**** hara**** as part of his mission to rid the sch*** of evil spi***s - have died down in the busy world of the sch***.
It would be painful to lose my pro***ional license and be away from the lift*** of the curse, but I was beginning to think that there was no need to rush if the days would pass like this.
But well.
There was no way that our ******ndings would alw*** be peaceful after being enchan*** by such a curse.

############################################################################################################# STARTED ON 1/16 #####################################################################################################################################
It was the day after I rece**** a warning from the ***ool.
'I need to talk to you this after**** while I'm doing my regu*** ***ckup. Even ***ugh you're on the verge of demotion, I'm sure you have work to do, so let me know what time is convenient for you.
Just bef*** morn*** HR. I rece**** a text mess*** from my child**** fri***, Kaede Kuzunoha, who is one year ahead of me.
After forming an internal team, the high ***ool ****ents of the Demon Acad*** go on to ****lete requests ***side the sch***, but this is trea*** as an afternoon exer****. In the ***nings, they have ***ular ***sses and class**** lect**** on ****niques, and in the ***nings, they have HR like a nor*** ***ool.
That's why I was try*** to send a text back to my childhood friend who mana*** the seal of the ***max expul**** ***ore the doc*** came.
"Hey, Furuya, you know what?　I heard there's a new student com*** to our class today. And it's a girl.
A boy sitt*** next to me was ***king to me in an ***ited manner. It was Kobayashi, a man who was disco***** by Soya's ****erous eyes to have a *****rious procl***** for 100% ***ast milk juice.
For a while after the bre***-avoiding woman incident, Kobayashi had been ***ing ***und ***ing, "Weren't you expe**** for ****ally haras**** the Shinonome City ***ster?
"Isn't it ***sual for a new student to move in at this time of year?　We've ***eady deci*** on our teams.
Oh, yeah, that's for sure.
I had a bad *****nition as I gave Kobayashi an *****priate response. It is true that he said there was a high possibility that he would be transf****** to the demon academy, but I haven't heard anyt**** from him since then, and to begin with, there are vari*** prob**** with him and me being in the same class after such a spi*** ***oval.
"Take your seats quic***, boys. I know it's a bit sud***, but you're tran****ring into class D today.
The ***cher in ***rge of class D said this as soon as she ***ered the ****sroom, foll**** by a girl wear*** a Demon Acad*** uniform entering the class****.
「「「「 ohhhhhhh! 」」」」」
Kobayashi and the rest of the boys cheered. Among them, Karasuma said, "Miss Boobs! 　Isn't that Miss Boobs? Karasuma was the most excited.
I loo*** up, ***ost ****gned to the fact that my bad premonition had come true.
I'm Mutsumi Nagumo. For some rea***, I'm actu**** a novice in the field of demonology, so I may cause you some trou***, but…… for now, ple*** take care of me from today.
***haps a ***tle ****sured by the excit***** of the boys, Nagumo bowed his head with a sli*** wince. She has an intere***** face that looks good with a pony****, and a well-trained body that can be seen with just one bow.
The bre***-avoiding woman we had expe**** two weeks ago - her host - stood embarr***** in front of the lectern. She's a lit*** smal*** than when I was in the ****ital, but it seems her big-breasted ****uise pad is still in place.
"Whoa, fina***, a ***ent ***tty girl in this class, ……and with big tits.
"Thank you,…… thank you, thank you.……
The boys ***ked up at the sky with a sense of devotion. This is what it means to be a Bud*** ***hout knowing it.
"Hey, what's with the smug look on your face, Furuya? Or are you used to ***ing ****tiful women with Misaki-chan and Kuzunoha-sama?
Kobayashi, who is 100% breast milk juice, pokes me on the ***ulder. But it seems that the new arrival of a ****tiful girl is more impor**** than his ****laced hate for me, and his *****ssion is slack and loose.
It's not like that.
And that's when I was dismissing Kobayashi's tangent.
BOGO!
"Oh, my God, I did it again!　 ……Sorry, it's still a lit*** hard to control.
With a roar, the white***** at the front of the ****sroom caved in. Nagumo, who was writ*** her name on the board, hurr***ly ***led out her arm, and this time, boom!　The *****board came off the wall.
「「「「 ……」」」」
############################################################################################################# FINISHED ON 1/16 ####################################################################################################################################
The classroom, which until then had been ***led with the excitement of ****tiful girls ***ing into the ***ool, fell silent.
"Oh, there's no need to hide it, so I'll expl*** at the outset that she's the ***mer host of Monster A in Shinonome City. She is the for*** host of the mons*** A in Shinonome City. Since the resi**** mons*** came out str***ly, we decided to take care of her. Well, ple*** consider this kind of aftercare as part of your job and get along with her. I live in the women's ****itory, so ple*** take care of the girls there as well.
Even tho*** the equipment in the classroom was broken, the teac*** cont****d to intro**** Nagumo ***hout a care in the world.
The ****ents were also initially taken aback by Nagumo's ****trous ****ngth, but their ****rest was ***ected elsewhere, as they ***ught this was just an ****yday occurrence.
"Hey, what'……s weird in Shinonome City?
I'm ***tty sure that Furuya sex***ly harassed her for the purp*** of ***ting rid of the ghost.
"What?　So, if the ***ors are true, then why did Furuya get…… the nipples of such a beautiful woman with big tits?
Whisper, whisper, whisper. I feel hot eyes on me from all over the classroom. Kobayashi ***ows era*** shav***s at me. A ***rby boy asks Karasuma about the truth, and he says, "I was so ***lous of that! I was so jealous!
Wait,…… wait, wait, wait, wait!
Just when the rumors of a sex***ly harassing demoness had died down, this would reig**** them!
Then, Nanumo's seat will be over there.
Damn, who went to the trou*** of transferring Nagumo to my class?…… While I was deva***ted, Nagumo's seat was ****gned to me. Fortunately, it's a seat far away from me. It's less than *****rting, but I'm reli**** to know that it's bet*** than hav*** to sit next to him.
Hey. Long time no see, Furuya.
…………………Hey, long time no see.
For some rea***, Nagumo took a dras*** detour to come in front of me and cal*** out to me in a friendly manner.
Stop it!　Notice me, Nagumo!　All the eyes in the classroom are on me at an alarming rate!
"What a pain in the ass. I went to the ***uble of assig**** you to the class with the sec***hand store ***ause I was ***ried about you.
Is that you? !　You're the one who transferred you into my class!
I don't know what to say, but I'm not sure what to say.
"Just get your ass back in your seat. We're still in the mid*** of homeroom.
The next mom***, I ***ned my head away from Nagumo and waved my hand to get rid of him.
"Huh? !
Nagumo jum*** up with a ***ange voice.
"What?　Wait, Nagumo?
What's with the sud***ness? You just made a lit*** ***take and my fingertip hit your arm, didn't you?
When I loo*** at Nagumo in surp****, she was blushing. She was look*** down at my hands, which were sealed with sil*** cross ****elets, with ****ngely passionate moist eyes.
With a lick of her tongue, her healthy ***ghs ****eted as if she was rememb***** ****thing.
"Yeah, you're right. There's no need to rush, there's plenty of time.……
After muttering somet**** meaningful, Nagumo wal*** *****adily to his seat.
 ……I ***der what it is. It's more than just a bad ***ling.
"……Hey, Furuya.
############################################################################################################# FINISHED ON 1/20 ####################################################################################################################################
As I froze, feel*** disquieted by Nagumo, Kobayashi, who was 100% breast milk juice, put his hand on my ****lder. What's the ***ter, Kobayashi? When you touch ***eone, you sho***n't have a ****btack in your palm, you know?
"As a friend, let me give you some advice. "As a friend, I'd advise you to at least buy some curse-re***ning tags.
And you're the first one to curse me, aren't you?
Ha-ha-ha.
His eyes weren't ***ling.
Somehow, I ***aged to get thro*** the morn*** in the classroom, and was try*** to esc*** from the classroom when the bell rang to end the class.
Wait, Furuya.
The ***son who ****ented me from ****ping was the homeroom ***cher of D class.
He even went to the trou*** of using a ****sman to bind me to a chair.
""Sir!　Thank you very much!
The boys in D class, who had been ***ting for the end of class to ***ture me, bowed their heads in unison. You guys don't have work this afternoon, do you?
No, no, no, no. I need to ask a favor of the ***ondhand store.
The teac*** then threw a tali**** at all the men and children, forc*** them to stop their ****ments. As ****cted of a pro, the D class ****ents had no defe***. The boys were ***ing, "You're tramp**** on the feel***s of the stud****! You're an educator! The teacher compl***** ***ored them.
Um, so, what do you want me to do for you?
The teacher glan*** at Nagumo and asked, ****ring the noise from the boys.
That's it. I want you to accom**** Nagumo to her make-up class.
 ……What?　Remedial work?
She'll mai*** be ***ing care of residual mons***s, but she'll also be a student of mine. She has to study to be a demoness. I'm going to ask her to use her afternoon practice time for make-up lessons, and you ***uld take them too. You can take it when you're not working.
No, no, no, no.
"Why me?
I sen*** a suspicious glint in Nagumo's eyes, and alm*** *****xively, I expre**** my ***ention to res***.
"Why? You're not only at the bot*** of your class, but your team is on the verge of ***ing its pro***ional license. Why don't you go get a good ***kout while you're at it. You and Nagumo know each other from the Shinonome City incident, so you're the perf*** attendant.
Gosh, a whole bunch of good arguments that are hard to refute!　 ……No, wait a minute, what?
"Then it doesn't have to be me, it can be Karasuma!　He'd be happy to chape**** you...
And when Nagumo ***ked at Karasuma, who was ***angely quiet for a newcomer, he saw
I'm sure you……'ll be able to ***ure out what's going on, but I'm not sure you'……ll be able…… to.
Karasuma was breat**** hard and struggling to control himself. I can't do that anymore. As a ***son.
"So, nice to meet you, old boy.
***ore I knew it, Nagumo, who had come next to me, smi*** and ***ghed with a vivacious smile.
"……Oh.
I'll have to ans*** Kaede's call after the make-up class is over……. And as I'm ***ting Kaede back in desperation after being rele**** from the ****sman.
And then you guys.
Nagumo spun ***und and tur*** to face the D class boys who were ****ntly pressuring me.
He stra****ened his back, put his hands on his hips, and ***ked so regal that it was hard to beli*** it was his first day at the new ***ool.
I don't know why you're ***ing into my busi****. I was under the care of Furuya at my prev**** sch***, so it's only natu*** that we seem to get along bet*** than ***ers. I'm not going to keep you all to mys***, so if you want to get to know me bet***, just tell me.
It was a ***tle out of line some***, but appar***** he was ***lowing up on me being ****eted for a kill. The man-child also rol*** his eyes after being told off by Nagumo.
I want…… you…… to put it on my ass... no, I want you to put it on my chest.
In an ***tant, I was caged in.
 ……Well, as a demon ***ter who fig*** ***inst evil spi***s and ***sters, maybe a lit*** bit of stupi**** is just right.
"So, I'm counting on you to be my chaperone from today, Furuya-senpai.
 ……I ***der if I was mist**** when I saw ****thing suspicious in Nagumo's eyes ***ing HR.
I ***ught about this when I saw Nagumo with a fresh smile on his face.
　　　　　3
I'm sure you've heard of it, but I've never heard of it. You can sense the stre**** of the oppo**** or find out the owner of the remote contr***** shikigami with the spi*** ***ion ****nique……, right?　Hmm?　Then what is the *******ication of shikigami?
It's the same as shapeshifting or ****ting spells, but it's ***ated as ****thing else. Ask Soya for details.
Soya-san!　I'll have to say hello to you too. I don't care about that perve**** woman cal*** Karasuma.
I guess my fears were just unfounded.
After finis**** the first make-up class, I ***ked aro*** the ***ool ****ding in the afternoon, when it was less popular, to show Nagumo to the girls' ****itory. In the meantime, Nagumo was ***ckly revie**** the cont***s of today's make-up class, ***ing me ****tions with her notebook in hand.
Nagumo is a ***son who used to go to national *****aments in kendo. His ****tude dur*** the make-up class was very ***ious, and he was prob**** a hard wor*** at heart. I was worr*** that he might get into ***uble like Karasuma, but he doesn't seem to have to worry about that.
"Well, it's kind of ***ange that you're not popular. Is that how it is at the ***ool for demonologists?
Nagumo loo*** ***und the hall*** curiously.
Oh, not so much in the mid*** sch***. It's not so bad in the junior high sch***, but in the senior high sch***, ****yone works outside or does indepe***** ****ning in the labs or on the field, so the sch*** buil**** bec***s less popular in the afternoon. There are no club *****ities either.
It was at that ***ent that I ****ally expl***ed to Nagumo, ****king that teaching the peculiarities of the trai**** ***ool for demonologists might be a part of the ******mentary lessons.
"……Oh, I see.
"What? 　Whoa! What?
It was an instant****** event.
The next thing I know, I'm being drag*** with *****ndous force into some empty classroom.
We'……re fina*** alone.
Nagumo, with a suspicious glint in his moist eyes, stood in front of the door, blocking the way out.
What are you doing……, Nagumo?
You ……know what?
blah blah blah blah blah!
Bef*** she knew it, Nagumo had *****toned her shirt and what ***lled out from her chest was a big-breasted disguise pad. The shirt, which was open in the front, ****aled a well-trained white belly and flat chest that I couldn't fig*** out where her boobs star***. ……I mean, wait a minute!　Seriously, wait!
I rea*** feel like my brea*** have got*** big*** since you did that to me.
Nagumo walked stra**** up to me and ***bbed my hand as fast as he could bef*** I could get away and pin*** me agai*** the wall of the classroom with *****ndous force.
It's not just a wall-don. I was *****etely *****iched ***ween Nagumo's wall-like upper body and the wall of the classroom, and Nagumo's wet ***ath ***oing seduct***** in my ear made my skin tremble.
"So, ple***. Please poke me again.
I'm not sure if this is a good idea or not……, but it's a good idea.
"Huh? What?
Nagumo let out a small sweet voice and her body and ***ghs shiv****.
"What the hell are you doing?
"I can't help it. Your exor**** was so intense that just *****bering it makes me feel weird.……
No, I don't want to hear that either, but bef*** that!
"Poke me again!…… I only did it beca*** there was no other way to get rid of the ghost!　Who would use it for breast implants!
"What? 　Breast implants? 　Tell me that again!
The for*** breast-avoiding woman ***ned red in the face and countered with tears in her eyes. Yeah, I'll tell you again and again!
"I can't use it for breast implants. It's a disgrace!　And we're on ***pus! And we're on campus!
Even Kaede nailed me!　 ……Well, that's right, Kaede!
"I have a meet*** later!　So I can't do what you're ***ing!
It sho***n't take more than an hour or two!　See?　It's just a lit*** poke, a ***tle poke!
Don't say that like it's just a scratch!　I'm not Karasuma!
Then Nagumo made a slug**** sound from the back of his throat, rubb*** his thi*** together.
"I'm asking you to do this ***ause I'm embarrassed.……
I don't know!
"……Enough. If…… that's what you want, I'll force ***elf on you.
"What?
Nagumo held both of my ***sts with one hand and held my thighs down with one rai*** leg.
I'm pre*** sure I have to take this off first…….
"No, seri***ly, stop!
Nagumo, oblivious to my voice, slips the bracelet with the silver cross off my wrist. Instantly, the lus*** of the cross dis***ears, and my hands and eyes ***ome inhuman.
But then Nagumo pinc*** my mid*** and ring ***gers, for*** them to stand up, and ****ibly brou*** the tips of them to her nipples. Nagumo's ****trous stre**** was *****etely ***ond the realm of human bei***, and it was ***ost *****sible to res***.
Hey, Tamma Tamma!　Calm down for a ***ond!　See?
Even…… if you say so, I'm on fire and can't ……take it anymore.……
Nagumo said with eyes that ***med to be floa**** with fever.
You!　You still haven't ***ten rid of that thing yet, have you? 　Go get some more couns*****!
"The ***ults of the counseling were perf***," he said. I mean, this is who I am, so there's no problem.
It's more of a problem!
Come on, be quiet.…… If you get too violent, you'll lose control.……
When I heard Nagumo's threatening words, the whiteboard that was ***shed in HR came to my mind. Gosh, if I don't do somet****, I'll ***lly be raped!　 ……Hmm?　No, it's not like I'm being raped, so does this mean I'm being raped in reverse? 　I don't know what's going on here!
While I was ****used, my cur*** fingertip was on Nagumo's tip...
"Mmm.
The ***ent I ***ched it, Nagumo jum***. The mom*** I ***ched him, Nagumo ***ped. ……But that was all.
"……Huh?　Why……?
While Nagumo was dumbfounded, I not***d the cause.
Nagumo's nipples were no longer ****sure apholes.
In fact, once a plea**** hole is poked, it can cha*** its ****tion to ***ther part of the body. In my human**** vis***, there was one spot ***und Nagumo's sho***er that was ***wing as a new *****disiac.
Oh, that was…… close.
"Ugh. Why? Why? Why……?
Nangumo poked her own nipples over and over with my finge***** and they bou***d.
I felt a ***tle bit sorry for her, and I ***ted her to stop ***ing her nipples with my fing*** as soon as ****ible, but ……anyway, as long as Nagumo can't see the ****sure scrotum, the ***max ****lsion spi*** will not be acti****d, and I was ****eved.
Rumble!
Mr. Furuya, it's past time for us to meet. Who are you mak*** a fuss with in this place?
"Whoa! !
Nagumo and I jum*** up at the sud*** intruder.
In particular, Nagumo's panic at the sight of her bare upper body wasn't half bad, and as a res*** of her ********hensible move to cover her ***asts with her shirt while hold*** my hand, my *****rtips touched Nagumo's sho***er, or in other words, her ****sure hole.
Shit!　Oh, shit.
By the time I thou*** that, it was too late for everything.
Boom!
Nagumo's body trembled grea***.
"……Ah, ah, ah, here it comes... this, this, this..…….
Nagumo puts his hands on both my shoul**** and buries his face in my neck as if he's ***ing to hang on to me. His lower body ****dered as he ***ust backwards, and the smell of wetness ****antly ****loped the area.
"I can't do……it when…….
Gyuuuuuuuu!　I felt a surge of ****ngth in Nagumo's upper body. As if ****ching for a place to come to in prepar***** for an explo****, her hot, fiery body ***ged mine, sweat ***ring down her face.
"I'm ***ing, I'm ***ing, I'm com***, I……, I'm ***ing, I'm com***, I'm com***, I'm com***, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming. ♥♥♥♥♥
BUSHAAHHHHH!　It's not a good idea. I'm not sure what to do.
Hot ***uid was spattered under my feet. Nagumo's whole body went into a ser*** of ***bid spasms. She arc*** her back so that I could see her throat, then hoo*** her finge***** ***und my body and colla**** to the gro*** with a sly, sly motion. She was in a posi**** to rub her droo**** cheeks ***inst the ***und as she ***ust her healthy buttocks out into the air, twitc**** as if it wasn't ***ugh. In her face, there was no trace of Kendo Komachi. Her unfoc**** eyes trembled in the after**** of her ***max, and her tongue, cove*** in sloppy saliva, hung *****essly from her mouth, while at the same time, a small charming voice ***ked out in the same ***thm as her body convulsed.
"Oh……, my God, I'm so fucked. I can't go ……on like this ……anymore…….
A whiz, a whiz.
How long had it been since the only sounds in the classroom were Nagumo's ****rious voice and the *****rious sound of water?
"……
When I ***ally came to my ***ses, I found ***elf eye to eye with a per*** stan**** at the entr**** of the classroom with a look of incomprehension on his face.
That guy who ****enly walked into the classroom and made me accide****** shoot my cli*** expul****...
……Furuya-kun?　What the hell…… are you doing……?
You can't ***take her for some*** else. It was my childhood friend, Kaede Kuzunoha, with her ***ress******* face and dense, ***dly ***rgy.
This is ****erent!
I ran to the win***, mouthing excuses that weren't even excuses.
Beca*** it can't be ***ped!　Beca*** Kaede's eyes were comp****ly that of a murderer!
I was convi**** that they would never ***ten to me ***perly, so I made up my mind to text them about the ****ation later and plun*** into the window.
I'm pretty sure I'm on the ***ond floor here, but a bone or two is a lot bet*** than being ***ght by the ***rent maple.
But...
"Whoa! Whoa!
A few ****smans ***pped by my side, and a wall of pale light ****ared, cove**** the classroom window.
How can you run away from me?
What the hell? 　Hot!　Hot!
Pale fla*** clung to my hands as my path of retr*** was cut off.
It's a ***fire, which is a ****rite of Kaede Kuzunoha, the heir*** of a ***ous ***ily cal*** "Kuzunoha the Haunted Fox.
My hands were not ***aged, but the heat in my flesh and blood was ***ugh to break my heart. If I resisted, I would be killed, no kidding.
"I've warned you many, many times, haven……'t I?　Don't use your pow*** carelessly, be care*** how you ***ave, or I'll kill you.
The icy expre***** on his face and the voice that ***nded like it was coming from the depths of hell.
Kaede looks down at me with the eyes of a ***ual pred**** and plays with the foxf***, shimmering in the palm of her hand.
If you make a mistake in your reply, you will be extinguished in an instant and your soul will be roasted.
"No, that's not it!　I ***ced ***elf on Nagumo. ……Hey, Nagumo!　You have to explain it to me too!
"Heeeheehee……...
Grasping at straws, he cal*** out to Nagumo, but Nagumo was still ***king his hips in oblivion.
 ……Once again, the ****rity of the curse that had befal*** me made me dizzy.
"Nagumo, I ……see. The vile sow lying there is the for*** ***ster A of Shinonome City.
I'm sure you……'re not the only one.
"So?　Are you say*** that you got to know her well ***ugh in Shinonome City to skip out on a meeting with me and use your abil*** on her?
"That's not why I'm here. I couldn't resist his monstrous stre****...
And that was when I was at a loss as to how to clear up Kaede's mis*********ding.
"Trust my cock radar. I heard ****thing ero*** over here!
"Really, Karasuma?
It's been a while since I fini**** work early, so I'd like to get back to my dorm and get some rest.
The voices of the D class boys led by Karasuma were approa***** us.
Oh, no!　This will only…… lead to more misunder*****ings.
I mean, that Karasuma guy, don't waste your time on ****thing like this!
"Tsk.
Kaede, realizing that she had ***ten into trouble, took a piece of prot***ion from her ***ket.
As soon as I saw what he was doing, I threw the tali**** at Nagumo, who was half naked and had a debau**** *****ssion on his face.
Bam.
When the smoke cleared, the high sch*** girl who had ***maxed *****peared. When the smoke cleared, the fig*** of the high ***ool girl who had reac*** her cli*** dis****ared, and in her place sat a cute stuf*** horse.
"Huh?　That ****sman.……
As I rol*** my eyes in surprise, Kaede released the ***ding on the window to start the ventilation and shot ***fire at the myste***** liq*** *****tered on the floor. The floor burned and smoked, and the ****ence fizz*** out of the window.
And as Kaede emer*** into the hallway.
"Huh? 　Miss Kuzunoha? What?
I heard the scr*** of Karasuma, who had been interrogated by Kaede ***ore, and the sound of ****steps mov*** away. What a handiwork.
"Well, we've ***ten rid of the *****loper and ***oved the ****ence. Now we can relax and continue our conversation...
Hey.
I was interrupting Kaede, who was ***ning her deadly ****ntion to me again, and asking her a ****tion.
I'm not sure what to make of it.
"……Oh, no.
Three years in the ***dle sch*** of the demon ***ool, Meie Taikawa.
He is an enigm**** ****rmant who will tell you all sorts of thi*** in exch**** for buying you a movie or tak*** you ****ping. When he confronted a breast-avoiding woman in Shinonome City, he gave her a ticket to bec*** a big-breasted woman in ex***nge for an embarrassing price. ****rary to Kaede, she is a cute junior with a loose and flu*** pers****ity.
I was ****ering where he got such a super rare prot***ion mark as a transfo******* mark, could he be ***ated to Kuzunoha? I asked Kaede about it.
"Don't try to ***ert me with …………………incomprehensible ****tions.　A tali**** like this is ***hing unusual.
No, such an advanced talisman can only be made by the main fam*** of Kuzunoha, if you think about it...
Anyway.
Kaede ****enly grabs my wrist and pulls me in tight.
"Forced or not, never use the power of this curse unl*** it's for work or an emergency. That's what I came to talk to you about today.
Then Kaede ***ssed the back of my hand ***inst her fore**** and began her usual ***chic ***ding to check if the seal of the cli*** expul**** had loosened or not. Suddenly, the warmth of Kaede's skin and the ***othness of her hair made me squirm, and I ****lowed my ques**** about the *******rmation mark.
The sight of Nagumo cli***ing?　That's more like a thrill, ***ost like a fear…….
Audit's on the move.
"Yeah, the ……audit *****tment, that audit depar*****?
I was ****tled by Kaede's words as she cut to the chase with a routine checkup.
The Audit *****tment is the associ*****'s self-cleansing organization that deals with the ***egal use of spiri**** power by ***ons. It is a *****tment that is partic****** ***red within the associ*****, as many of its mem***s come from the "Nine Old Families" beca*** of its origins.
They're going to send some*** to watch you to make sure you don't use your ***ers unnecessarily. I don't know who they're going to send yet, but…… you and Soya's ****hter are going to make such a show of it.
Kaede spat viciously, but no mat*** what she said, that was the only way to save Nagumo, so what the hell.
I'm sure you'll be able to fig*** out what's going on. Even if it's just you, peo*** from your ***ily tend to be ***ked at in a nega**** light.
……Yeah, I know.
The place where I grew up. I grew up in an orpha**** that took in children who had lost their homes to ****itual disasters.
And my adop**** fat*** was the owner of the ****lity and a very skil*** demonologist who gave me a simple seal to remove the cli***.
However, after his death, his ***ter ***her tur*** into an unprece****** ***dge-generat*** spirit with a spirit class ***ing of 7, caus*** the pants of the ***ire Kanto region to disappear, and then asce**** to heaven with my cli*** expulsion. He left this world in a way that stained his last days.
After that, each of us from the faci**** rece**** support from the *****iation and went on to ***ious careers, but those of us who have stayed in the demon industry, like ……me, try not to talk about the faci**** to ***ers as much as poss****. Well, that's natu***. The owner, in other ……words, the parent's ****anor is even in the textbooks.
"Yeah, no ***nge in the internal seal this week either. It doesn't seem like the curse has gotten any worse.
That's what I've been ***ing all along…….
After a longer than usual checkup, Kaede ***ally removed the back of my hand from her forehead.
I'm sorry…….
And then I saw Kaede ***ring at my wrist, and I ***dered what it was.
Oh, Nagumo ***bbed me hard ***ugh to get the bracelet off.
My wri*** were red. It didn't look like it was going to bruise, so I didn't care.
"Tsk. That's why you're so full of holes, so they force you to use your abili****.
Kaede ***cked her tongue, and for some ***son, desp*** her grumpiness, she ***pped a healing talisman ***und her wrist.
As I was thin**** how unusu**** kind she was, Kaede quic*** healed…… my wrist and sudd**** pinc*** it as hard as she could.
What the hell? 　What the fuck are you doing?
You're going to hurt me in the same place after I'm healed!　Isn't this more likely to leave a mark?
"Shut up. Let's continue with the checkup. How's the voice?
You're too noisy, you're too unattached.
I haven't heard ……that since. Never.
A girl's voice echoes in my head in my dre*** ever since I was *****rized by the ***max expulsion.
When I got rid of the milk-avoiding woman, I could hear it even tho*** I was awake, but I never heard it again. At the same time, the addit***** abil*** to make even ****ganic mat*** cli***, which made no sense, was also now usel***.
"Yes. That's good, but make sure that no one knows about ……that voice. Not only the watcher, but also Soya's ****hter. Don't tell ***one.
"Ugh, okay, okay, okay.
I don't know what she was so cautious about, but Kaede's expre***** had an unmistakable power.
Good. Then I'm done talk*** to you. Now get the hell out of here.
No, no, wait a minute. What are you going to do about Nagumo?
Nangumo is still left in the cor*** of the classroom, ***ing been transfor*** into a stuffed animal by the power of Kaede's talisman.
I'll carry her back to the dorm. You don't have to worry about it.
"No, I'll help. It's my respons*******.
I'm ***ried about Nagumo if I leave it to you alone.
If by any cha*** the transformation were to be ***one in the middle of the day and you were seen with a child in this state, it would be a disaster. Don't you under***** that?　I'm ***ling you to get the hell out of here.
Kaede then threw me out of the classroom with all the force of her daily stress.
I don't know what to do.…… I'm not going to have any time to rest if you're going to be in trouble with a nasty ***ster coming out.
I was about to leave the place quietly, but Kaede's complaint ***pped me in my tracks.
A nasty anomaly……?
The fact that the Audit Depar***** had taken notice of my abili**** was eno*** to send chi*** down my spine, but I'……m much more conce**** about the ***ster that Kaede describes as "troublesome".
But well, for now, anyway.
I'll have to be very care*** not to leave you alone with Nagumo.……
He went back to his dorm, puzzling over the situa****.
　　　　　4
The day after I had a rough time with Nagumo and Kaede.
Was it the ***ect of the cli*** expulsion or did Kaede do ****thing?
I was a ***tle relieved to see that Nagumo was absent from school on the sec*** day of his new job.
You can't help it, beca*** you don't know ……what you sho*** look like when you meet her…….
However, I was still worr*** about Nagumo's health. I was on my way to the store in betw*** clas*** to ask the few girls in D class (other than Karasuma) to check on him.
"Oh, Mr. Furuya!　Nice timing!
An ****getic Soya came runn*** up to me from ***oss the hallway.
I've just decided on my next perve**** case.
I ***ught we were going to be cautious for a ……while?
Well, as long as I have a job, I can avoid the make-up class with Nagumo, which is great for me.
The day ***ore ****erday, Soya's expre***** ***med to be a lie, and I asked him, conf****.
"Just now, huh?　I found a case that ***ked just right. Here it is.
The phone that Soya han*** me sho*** an article from a news site.
There was a *****rious headline that read, "A ***ster of justice appears! There was a *****rious headline that read, "A ***ster of justice appears!
"A righteous ***ster……?
After ***ding the article, it seems that str*** mons**** like the milk-avoiding woman are ****ently occurring thro***out the Kanto region.
And if you're wonde**** why that mons*** was ***led justice, the rea*** was the victim.
"What ……kind of mons*** att***s ****philes all the time?
Currently, there are a total of ***rty vict***, ten with minor injuries and ***nty with seri*** injuries, who have been confi****.
Eighteen of them were in *****ssion of ***ious ***ita magaz**** when they were atta****, which led to the ****tence of a ***ster that ***acks only pedop****s.
The article, which ***inly lays out the inform***** that is curr***ly known, however, ****luded with this.
However, some ***erts have said that the ****tence of pedop*****, who cause ***iety in their ***ents' generation, is ***elf a bad thing, and that the associ*****'s stance of ******erally b***ing the ****ters who try to elimi**** them is ******onable.
No, I don't think the intell******s have any common sense.　It seems that the pedop**** who was atta**** by a mons*** is not actu**** a criminal who messed with children.
The ***ment ***tion was wild with ***ple who ***med to have thou*** the same thing as I did, but some of them said ***ngs like "lolicon, wow! "Let's give it a ***ler name. "Let's come up with a ***ler name. How about Pedop**** Sla***? How about "****phile Slayer? "Let's give it a cooler name.
"I ……see. So this is the one Kaede was referring to as the "troublesome ***ster.
I can't be sure, but I'm pretty sure.
It is a ****itual pheno***** in which peo*** who are cons**** by complexes, ***dges and spite are ***ned into evil spirits while still alive. Due to its ***ure, it is not ****mmon for vengeful or righteous mons**** to appear. And sometimes these ****ters are ****ctly ****ected to the pub*** sentiment, which can make the *****iations that try to deal with them more diffi**** to deal with.
This pedop**** ***yer is one of them. ***king at the comm**** sect*** of the news, there are many peo*** who say that ****philes dese*** to be atta**** and sho*** be acti**** hun***. I would like to beli*** that they are noisy ***ple, but the loudness of their voices is quite troublesome.
"……Hey, Furuya-kun. Is Kaede ***haps referring to Kuzunoha-san?　The fox.
And I was just thin**** about the troublesome nat*** of such a mons*** as the pedop**** sla***.
Do you ***ally talk or somet****?
Soya, who had sudd**** toned down for some ***son, asked me somet**** ***ange.
I'm not sure if I've ever said that ***ore. I'm not sure what to make of this. I'm not sure if it's a good thing or not.
I ***ost ***led him out, but then I ****mbered that he had punched me in the ***mach for not calling him out in ***lic, so I chan*** my mind.
"……Hmm. Oh, yeah, from long ……ago.
"What?　What's wrong with your face? What's wrong with you?
I felt a sud*** pain in my stomach.…… I don't know, did I eat too much breakfast?
Soya is serio**** ***king at me stran****. Hey, hey, hey, are you okay?
"Well, you were sick in the ****ital ***ore, weren't you?　Your face ****enly ***ned red. Didn't you get some kind of weird psyc*** influence?　Hospitals are full of such thi***.
"Oh, I guess so. I've been ***ling stra*** ever since I was in that ****ital, and the doctor said there was noth*** wrong with me. Let's…… get a pro*** demonologist to take a look.
Soya ***ked up with a "haha" and raised his ***sion as well.
No, no, no!　I'm not ***king about that, I'm ***king about work!　Work!
Bef*** I could say, "Hey, don't take it too hard," Soya took the phone back from me and dis***yed ***ther ***een. It's the ****base of the *****iation that I accessed with my ****orary license that was ***ost confiscated.
It seems that the ****phile ***yer has been ****ading too widely, so they're asking for help from all demon slay*** with a ****orary license or higher. It's a weird case that seems to be ****ected to sex*** relics, and if you can solve it, you can get rid of your temporary license in one fell swoop, and this is the only case you can go after next!
Soya ***ures me excitedly.
But you're ****aring in the ent*** Kanto region, right?　It was a lot of work just in Shinonome City, but isn't this just going to be a waste of time?
"Tsk, tsk. That's sweet, Mr. Furuya. This time I won't be patroll*** in the dark.
Soya ***nted at his own eyes with his deliberately raised index finger.
"The ****phile sla*** att***s pedop*****, right?　And my abil*** is...……
"Oh, I see. I see.
Looking at Soya's eyes, or whore's eyes, I can get a general idea of the plan she has in mind.
I'm going to start working as soon as poss**** this afternoon, so tell Aoi-chan about it!
After ***ing that, Soya retu**** to class B in a good mood.
●
Soya's plan was to use a ****ough ambush style.
Soya's ****erous eyes, which can ***eal all kinds of ***ual information just by look*** at a per***'s face, can rev*** a true ****phile, and she will guard him or her until the ****phile ***yer comes to att*** (also known as stal****). It's a perfect ****tegy with no holes. It's a perfect strategy with no holes! Soya said.
That's why we took the train from Demon ***demy to Harugahara Station, where many stores of this kind are said to be located.
Since it would be bad to stand out too much this time, all of us, including Karasuma, wore plain cas*** clot***. Well, both Soya and Karasuma have outstan**** looks, so they attr*** a lot of atten**** anyway.
While Soya was scurrying ***und look*** for a real ****phile, Karasuma, who see*** to be in a daze, mutt**** to himself.
I don't under***** the app*** of loli, either.
"Huh?　That's surpris***.
I was also bored, so I repl***, and for some reason Karasuma's lips pur*** indignantly.
"What's the surprise? What the hell do you think I am?
Bea*** in the skin of beautiful girls. An anthropomorphic male organ. A *****aceful perv*** for life.
"To be hon***, I thou*** Karasuma was okay with any girl, but he's not?
I'm not sure what to make of this, but I…… think it's a good idea.
Oh, I can kind of see that.
Karasuma's phrasing was shitty, but I know what he meant.
"Espec***ly when you have a ***ter or ****thing. Not just loli, but youn*** ***ple in general look like lit*** animals.
"Huh?　Furuya-kun, do you have a ***ter?
Soya joi*** the conversation, ***king aro*** at the crowd, as if he was lon*** ***hout being ****uded in the conversation.
No, my sis*** is not ***ated to me by blood, since we lived in the same institution. We're the same age. We're the same age. She's just like a sister to me. There is only one such per***.
Piku.
Soya, who had been ***king aro*** at the crowd, shook his shoul**** and ****enly ***ked back at me.
"Oh, rea***? Then that girl is like…… Kuzunoha-san, or rat***, more than Kuzunoha-san, isn't she?　What are you doing now?　Do you keep in touch with her?
What's with the Soya guy? Soya, your eye!　There's a heart in your eye!　I'm pretty sure that's the most evil mode, where you pour spi***ual power into a whore's eye and rev*** the length of her lower half! 　Stop it!
 ……Oh, by the way, Soya's leche**** eyes won't rev*** what I did to Nagumo, will they?　It's not like I ***ssed any lines, so…… what's the definition of a line?　Is it safe to cli***?　Is it okay if I don't fanta**** about it with Nagumo?
What do you think, Mr. Furuya?
While I was ****used, Soya conti**** to stare at me with his heart-fil*** eyes, not letting up on his pursuit. I don't know what's ***hering you so much, but I can't keep searc**** for *****hiles like this, and I don't feel comfor***** either.
Most of the ***ple from the orphanage go to regu*** schools with the help of the associ***** and Kuzunoha, and live a ***mal life. But that guy...Sakura...he was ****erent from us, he had tal***. I'm pretty sure he was taken in by a ***mer Twel*** Hea*** master or ****thing like that, and he's doing great.
Soya see*** to be say***, "So? I felt that Soya was ***king with his eyes, so I conti****.
I was ****rised when I heard that he was going to appr***ice himself to the ***mer Twe*** Masters. I hadn't heard from him in a while, tho***, ***ause he was going ***ough a lot of ****ning and I was ***ely able to keep up with his classes. I ***der if he's doing well.
I told her honestly that I had nothing to be ***amed of, and she reca**** a ***ies of ****ries of Sakura that I had ***ost ****otten.
When I was in elementary school, she would crawl under the cov*** at night say***, "I don't want to be with you unless I'm with my ***ther," and on my birthday she would write me a letter say***, "I'm going to be your wife.
I had bec*** a kind of caretaker, and she was very fond of me. I was so happy to have a real sister that I ***rted to take the initiative in prote***** her.
And now you'……re babysitt*** this dirty team.
Why are we ****enly being dissed?
Karasuma ****ests, but you're the dirtiest one in terms of per***ality, okay?
"……Heh.
And for some reason, Soya himself, who had pursued him seve****, was relea**** a ***ange ****sure with a half-smile of disapproval. What are you *****aining about? I'm sure I spoke pretty well, didn't I?
"Your *****ssion is rela***, Furuya-kun. You're the one who's a pedop****, aren't you?
"Hey, if you had eyes, you'd know that's not true! 　Don't make any crazy accusations!
If Soya's sex information is true, a lot of ***ple will beli*** it. It's no joke.
So we ****inued our ***rch for a pedop**** for a while, but we couldn't find one worthy of being ***led a ***uine pedop****, so we broke up at an early hour.
The num*** of pedop***** is ******singly small…….
●
"Huh?　What are you doing, Kobayashi?
When I retu**** to the dormi****, I found that a large ***unt of lugg*** had been taken out of the next room. I ***ped into the owner of the house, Kobayashi, who is a 100% mother's milk juice producer, and when I ***led out to him, he too had an ******icable *****ssion on his face.
The…… dorm manager ****enly told me to move to a ****erent room.
"What?　So you're ***ing in the same day?
"Yes, yes. It was a quick deci**** ***ause I was paid quite a lot of money for my time and effort, but I ***der if a male transfer student will come after Nagumo-san?
Kobayashi still loo*** at me stran****, but then ****enly smi*** leche****ly.
Maybe he's the kind of guy who'd go out of his way to get next to you.
"Don't do that.……
You're being ****eted by some*** who wants you to cli*** for breast implants…….
I brus*** aside Kobayashi's ***nous remark and went back to my room.
The dormitory of the Demon ***demy is ****cally a ***gle room for each student. This is partly to nour*** one's ene***, and partly to make it easier for each student to hide their secret arts.
The room layout is 1DK, and ****ough it has a spacious kitchen, it is a waste of space since most stud**** eat at the cafeteria or conven***** stores.
"Oh shit. I've got to take out the trash.
I ***ays for*** to take out the trash when I oversleep, and then I have to dodge the trash bags that accumulate on my doorstep.
"Oh, I'm so tired today.……
I lay down on the bed bef*** ***ting dres***. I've fal*** ***eep a few times doing this, but I can't seem to stop this habit.
"I can't let ……Sakura see this. "I can't let Sakura see me liv*** like this.
Then there are these two hands.
A curse that he hid even from his ***ily who spent time with him at the facility.
I was in a daze, ***king up at my hands, which were ****bited by the ***max expulsion spirit.
I ****dered as my phone alerted me to an inco**** text.
I ope*** my mail*** carelessly to see if I had rece**** a message from Soya or Kaede, and I couldn't help but say, "What?
I wonder if this is the kind of thing that can be ***led a sha*** if one ***aks of it.
"I'll be there ****rrow.
The sender of that short email, which simply stated the requirements, was... Buncho Sakura.
I couldn't take my eyes off my phone for a while, ***ause of the sud*** call from the sister I grew up with.
Chapter 2: There's No Way My Sister Is This Tough
　　　　　1
On that day, an all-school asse**** was scheduled to take place ***ore noon at the Tokyo Metropolitan Demon ***demy.
In a busy school like Demon Academy, espec***** in the high school, there are not many events like this.
However, at this time of the year, after the first year stud**** have ****leted their first assessment, many of them seem to loosen up, and it is ****omary for the ****hers to give vari*** warnings at the assembly.
***haps it was beca*** we were lined up in gro***, but there was a lot of buzz in the gym ***ore the meeting ***rted.
"Oh, he's so paranoid.…… Oh, he's still ***ing an affair.……
Miss Misaki!　It would be a shame to keep your eyes clo*** like that!　You must ***ehow find Mistress Kuzunoha and the other S-class beau**** in this crowd, discover their naughty secrets, and rep*** them to me!
It's a lit*** difficult to see the information with the whore's eyes when they're too far away, ……but Aoi-chan, if you're too noisy, you'll be ****shed again.
"No, that's ******onable!　I was just try*** to sati*** the healthy intellectual ****osity of a sex boy! I was just ***ing to sati*** the healthy intellectual curiosity of a sex boy!
My team was no exc***ion, with Soya, who was gro*** from his ****erous eye, and Karasuma, who was energetic from his naughty fantasies, chatting away as if they had too much time on their hands.
Meanwhile, as for me...
"What's the mat***, Furuya-kun? You've been play*** with your phone all day.　You've got dark ***cles under your eyes.
What?　Oh, no, not rea***. Just keep your eyes closed, Soya.
I don't know how many times I've repe**** the same ***ion since yesterday. I've been refre***** my mailbox and chec**** all over to see if I've ****ived any mail from Sakura.
Yesterday, I rece**** a text message from Sakura ***ing that she was coming over there.　Do you know the way?　Do you want me to pick you up at the stat***? I replied, "When? I was so worried about Sakura's ***ety that I hadn't been able to sleep at all.
Miss Misaki. It's not ****thing to pry into too much. Furuya is also a man. He must have a lot of patience after ***ding his unprecedented ****rite ero*** image.
I'm not with you!
"?　Why else would I be fiddling aro*** with my phone and cro*** ***ides pornographic ***ges?
I do. Worrying about your sister's ***ety and all that.
But I didn't say anyt**** about it. I didn't want any*** to know that Sakura was coming.
Why?　That's obvious.
Because the only ***ple ***und me are the ones who seem to be a bad influence on Sakura!
The guys in D class were going to talk a lot about the rumors that I had sex***ly harassed ***ple in Shinonome City, and Karasuma was out of the ****tion. I also didn't like the idea of Soya's lecherous eyes ***king at Sakura.
And there's that guy who's been coming back to school today...
Um, are you okay here?
Oh, Mr. Nagumo? 　You've ***lly moved to a new school!　It's okay, it's okay, just line up here.
 ……He's here.
Kendo Komachi, Mutsumi Nagumo, with her ponytail ***ying, hurri**** joins the line via Soya.
Geez, that Nagumo guy. You ***med to be avoiding me this ***ning, what are you doing?
As I braced mys*** beh*** the stu*** Karasuma, who was hold*** his chest, "Ugh, Mistress Mutsumi's body odor is so close……, be still, my testicles…… of my heart.
"Yo, yo, secon***** store.
After the ****ting with Soya, Nagumo skipped Karasuma and came to me as usual. He also tug*** on my hem a lit*** bit. What is it?　I'm not sure if this is a good idea, but it's a good idea.
"Furuya, I'm sorry about the other day!
In a whisper. But in a clear and sincere voice, Nagumo bowed to me. ……What?
"After yesterday, Kuzunoha-san told me about it. I didn't mean to bot*** you, my benefactor. I didn't mean to cause trouble for you, my benefactor, but I couldn't ……help myself when I ***ught I had a breast ******tation *****tunity in front of me.
"Um...……
I'm not sure what to make of this, but I'm sure you'll be able to fig*** it out.
Kaede told him about the ****ation and he's feel*** very sorry for himself.
Well, I hope you *****stand.
Good. I ……knew Furuya was a good guy.
For now, I'm relieved that I don't have to keep Nagumo away from Sakura.
……But...
And then Nagumo spoke up.
I wonder if it would be a problem if we did it ……consensually and secretly?
No, I'm not!　You don't ****ally feel sorry for your**** at all, do you? No!
I knew it! He's no good!
I guess I sho*** continue to keep an eye on Nagumo.
I'm not sure what to do.
"Hmm?
Suddenly, a tug on my ***eve from beh*** made me turn aro***.
"Oh, what?
There was Soya, look*** down at his hands curiously for some reason.
Oh, no, the meeting's about to start, so I ***ught we'd bet*** be quiet.
Soya hurr***ly took off his sleeve and said, "Furuya, you!　What are you doing ***ing frie*** with Miss Mutsumi when I'm the one who has to put up with you? He ***hed aside the ***ious Karasuma and ***tled down next to me.
What is it?　I ***ught to myself, "What's going on?" But then the meeting actu**** ***rted, so I got in line with Nagumo.
I ***lly can't let Sakura see them. I rea*** can't let Sakura meet all of them, so I want to cont*** them ***orehand so that Sakura doesn't come to see me dire**** at the Demon Academy. Why doesn't ……Sakura's guy reply to me?
I was starting to get ***lly worried about Sakura's safety, but I couldn't play with my phone after the meeting had star***, so I put it away in my poc***.
 ……Huh?　What's with the heavy air?
As the ***mur of the ****ents quieted down, I ***iced a ***ange sense of ***sion drifting from the *****uctors ***ting at the edge of the room. I could feel it, so ***urally the other ***chic ****ents could sense it as well, and even Karasuma, who had been ***king ****ense earl***, furr**** his brow in wonder.
Eventually, the teacher in charge of the event stood up in front of the microphone and said the usual line, "Now, we will begin the spr*** school assembly," but what ****owed was compl***** unexp*****.
'But first. We want our students to have a ***ong sense of power and to behave in a ****rate manner, so we have decided to bring in a ***cial instructor today.
Huh?　Special instructor?
The sudden turn of events cau*** a mur*** not only from the first year students but also from the second and third year students. The murmur grew even louder when the ***cial instructor appe**** on the stage at the urg*** of the moderator.
"What?　What's with that girl? She's the same age as us. And she's ***ring our uniform.
"I mean, she's ***lly cute, isn't she?　I can't rea*** tell from the ****ance, but her tits are pretty…… good too.
I could hear the voices ***und me, and Karasuma was screa**** "Harasho! I was in a state of shock.
The pet*** girl on the stage was about the same age as us. Her long side-tails swa***, and her ***some eyes loo*** stra**** down at us from the stage. Her arms and legs have grown longer, and her chest has grown considerably in the time I haven't seen her in a while. But there was no ****aking her figure.
"……Sakura?
The girl who bowed prou*** on the stage was her ***nger sister, Bundoori Sakura, who had spent ***eral years under the same roof.
It's nice to meet you. I've been dispa***** by the Auditing *****tment of the Demonologist Associ***** to work as a special instructor at this school from today.
The whole school went silent for a few ***ents, as did I, when I heard the ****ting.
What?　"What? Are you ……kidding me, a girl that young in the ****ting department?　I mean, the audi**** department is ****hing the school.……
"That's why the teachers are so nervous." "……Wow, that's hard to do.
I'm not sure if…… it's true or not, but I think it's possible that there are some dan***ous ***ple in the school.
When the students heard the name of the audi**** department, they let out various shouts of agitation.
But there was a sligh*** diffe**** commotion going on ***und me.
"Hey, hey, Mr. Furuya, do you mean ……***rry blos***s?……
Brother-in-law!　Please give me your sister!　I'll do ****hing!
Soya turns to me with an aston***** *****ssion, and Karasuma bumps his head against my toes on his sliding knees. In addition, Karasuma was ***ing to peek ins*** Soya's skirt in the confusion.
Oh, shut up, you idiot!　For God's sake!　Just be quiet for a minute!　I'm so overwhelmed, and so am I!
The reason I've been sent by the ****ting department is that there have been rumors ……recently that some students at this school may be ****ging in ****tionable ****vior dur*** ****cisms.
""Ack!
I, Soya, and Nagumo's ****lders jum*** in unison.　Soya and Nagumo's shoul**** jum*** in unison.
"What?　Was the rumor that the Audit Department was going to make a move for real?
So it's Furuya's fault…… that a nasty guy from the Audit Department is here?
The rumors that had been quieting down ***med to be rekin***** at a treme***** rate.
All the ***ple aro*** us were star*** at us at the same time, and some*** ***ple were leav*** our team.……
Wait a minute!　Don't look at me like I'm some kind of filth!
I mean, sure, my hands are like filth, but the only one who's really dirty is Karasuma!
However, there was no way that the cries of her heart could reach the ***ple aro*** her, and ……Sakura conti**** to greet them ****ilessly on the stage.
I have been *****tched to corr***, monitor, and ****rvise the curr*** situa**** of the Demon Academy. For the sake of *****nience, I belong to the D class of the first year of high school, and I'll be in room 407 of the student dormitory. So, if you see any traces of illegal spiri**** power use or anyt**** stra***, ple*** let me know immedi*****. So long.
Sakura then bowed. She step*** off the stage with a comp****ly ****rried gait.
 ……Let's see, where's class D?　407, that's a room ***ber I've heard bef***?
I feel like I'm so overwhelmed with information that my mind can't keep up.
"If it's true that you're an active member of the Audit Department, you're in S class, right?　……"If that's true, you're an active member of the ****ting department.
No, more ****rtantly, wasn't room ***ber 400 in the boys' dorm?
That's right!　Forty-seven is the room I was in until yesterday!　That means it's right next to Furuya's!　Why are all those cute girls gathering at his place?
With a force that pierced thro*** the buzz, Kobayashi, who was 100% breast milk juice, was ****aming.
Perhaps the ***ling was the ****sive factor, as more and more ***ple began to leave our group.
I'm ***eady gett*** the full "Oh, you're here to watch him" look thr*** at me.
In the midst of all this, Karasuma continued to get down on his knees, while Soya squinted, saying, "Mmmm, I can't…… see very well from a ****ance.
"Hey, I don't know, is this maybe my fault? I don't know.
Nagumo ***kes my sho***er and asks in a whisper.
I'm not……sure what to make of this. But then how am I going to get breast implants?
You sho***…… be ***ring silicone by now.
In his conf**** mind, he could ***ely think of such a thing.
　　　　　2
After finishing the meeting with a compl***** blank mind, I ran out of the gym, passing Soya and the others in the crowd. It wasn't that I couldn't stand the scorn and ******roving stares that surro***** me, it was that I ***ted to talk to Sakura as soon as possible. One on one.
(What's with the…… Audit Department? What's with the che*** ***ssoms? What kind of incomprehensible reunion is ……this?
I have so many ****tions I want to ask.
But it's been a long time since Sakura greeted me, so I don't know where she is.
I tried asking in the staff room, but the teachers were ***ntly alarmed, "What are you going to do? I couldn't get any good information from them. That's ****ible. What did I do? ……Climax expulsion?
So I ran ***und the school for a while, but I couldn't find any ***rry ****soms, and when I went back to the dorm, I ***ught, "No way.
Oh, man, they're really moving in!
A moving company's truck was par*** at the ****ance of the dormitory.
That means Sakura is in room 407!
I was about to run up the sta*** when I loo*** up at the boys' dormitory that I was so familiar with.
"Hey!　Furuya Haruhisa!
When I ***ned ***und to hear my name cal***, a girl was walking ***ard me from beh*** a truck.
For a moment, I really didn't know who it was.
It ***uld have been much clo*** than on the stage. ****ough he had grown in many ways, he was *****itely a familiar face. But the voice and the *****ssion on his face were so piercing.
Long time no see, Haruhisa Furuya. As I sent you an e-mail yesterday, I'm here. I'm here to keep an eye on you.
It was the oppo**** of the image I had in my memory. Even the way she spoke was different. Buncho Sakura ***ked stra**** at me with eyes as if she was ***king at dirt, and said as if she was going to throw up.
I had so many quest**** I ***ted to ask.
What's the Audit Department? Do you belong to such a place?　What was the point of your *****oyant ****ting earl*** when you were talk*** about surveillance? Are you eating well?　How much do you know about cli*** expulsion?
But the first thing that came out of my mouth was these words.
"What's the mat***, Sakura……? Why do you call me Haruhisa Furuya?　You used to call…… me "big brother".
"Huh?　Gross.
I thou*** I was going to die.
I'm not a kid anymore!　You can't call me that! I'm not a kid anymore!
What was it that she didn't like so much? Sakura's sho***ers were angry as if she wan*** to bite him.
And I've had ***ugh of being ***led "Haruhisa Furuya" when I'm under suspi**** of somet**** as trivial as you!　You ***uld be ****eful that I don't call you by your ***ber!
Seriously, what's wrong with the che*** ****soms……? Is it some kind of rebellion?
Or was it the way she spoke, the way she greeted me on the stage, and the fact that she belongs to the audi**** department that made her behave this way, knowing so much about ***max expulsion……?　If that's the case, I'm really going to kill myself.
When I couldn't say ****hing to her, she narrowed her eyes as if to reproach me.
I mean, do you even know what you're doing?　Okay?　I heard that you now have the abil*** to eliminate ***ual harassment, which I don't understand...
Beep beep.
Just then, as if to interrupt Sakura's words, my phone alerted me to an ****ming call.
Come on…….
What?　No, it's fine.
Right now, my prio**** is talk*** to Sakura.
"Just ***wer it. ……Or is it someone you don't want me to hear from?
"No, it's not like that.……
****come by Sakura's ***ange pres****, I ***ked up my phone. The name that appe**** on the scr*** was... Kobayashi. Ugh, seriously, I don't care!　Go drink your mother's milk!
"……Hello?
Furuya!　Are you all right? You okay?
"What?
As soon as I ***ked up the phone, Kobayashi ***rted ramb**** on in an ****emely flustered manner.
I apologize in advance!　Seriously, I'm sorry!　But you know what?　We didn't mean it either!
No, no, no, no. Just calm down. I don't understand what you mean. Explain it to me.
He urged Kobayashi on, with Sakura lis***ing intently.
"No, it's just that ……earlier, as a ***tle prank, we were all ****king pegs into straw dolls with your hair in them.……
What the hell are you doing?　What do you mean, "all of us"?　Don't leave me out!
I……'m not sure…… what to make of this.
What?
A large num*** of ***ughts gath**** from all over the school, and a curse spirit with a class 4 rating was born.……
I'm not a hamster!　You're not a hamster!
I don't know what to make of it, but I'm not sure what to make of it.　I'm not sure what to make of it. 　I'm not kidding!
I'm sure…… you'……ll be able to figure out the best way to do it.
You're born? 　No, seriously, I'm not a hamster!
I ***ught this might be Kobayashi's prank call, no mat*** how much it cost.
Oh, wow.
There was some kind of vindictive voice from a distance that see*** to belong to an outsider.
And it's clea*** moving ***ser to us.
I'm sure you'll be fine. 　I'm not sure what to make of it. I'm sorry.
It's not gonna be okay!　You're gonna have to remember that later!
As I was about to break off the call with Kobayashi and tell Sakura to run, a large shadow sudd**** fell on the gro***.
"Mitsuketa.
"Whoa! What?
Behind the che*** blos****, peek*** out from the shad*** of the boys' dormitory and ***king down at us was a huge, gas-like woman. It was a curse spirit that ***med to take the form of an evil spirit itself. ……I'm not sure what to make of this, but I'm sure it's a good idea.
"Mitsuketaaaaaaaa!
A curse spirit that resem**** Soya ****cked us with *****ndous speed!
Run, Sakura!　While I draw them away!
I stepped forw*** to ***tect Sakura, and almost reflexively removed my bracelet.
If it were true, using cli*** expulsion in front of the ***rry ****soms would be a ***ice that would never be made.
It seems that a lot of thi*** have ***eady been ***osed anyway, so…… this abil*** is too shitty to reopen. However, it is said that the curse spirit is fast and can also cause dam*** to the surrou****** of the target if the surg*** is not good ***ugh.
If I ****ally use my ***lity in front of Sakura and she hates me even more than she does now, I'll die ***tally, but it's ……still much ***ter than hav*** her get hurt.
"I'm your brother, Sakura!
He shou*** as if he were ***ing to get into the spirit, and then he strained his eyes to look for the curse spirit's plea**** aphrod***** with his alien**** vision.
"So...
I ***ught I heard an irritated voice from Sakura.
What?
My body was hovering in the air as if it had lost weight.
I told you I'm not a kid anymore!
"Buh-beh! 
I was slam*** into the gro*** from ***ind. I'm sure you'll be able to understand why I'm here.
Zang!
As soon as Sakura thr***s the metal brac*** with the talisman ***pped ***und it into the gro***, a wall of light appears betw*** us and the curse spirit. As soon as the grudge spirit that resembles Soya ***shes into the wall, the wall deflects like a trampoline.
"Watch this, Haruhisa Furuya!
In response to Sakura's words, who ***med a mark and pou*** her spiri**** power into the metal ***tings on the gro***, the curse spirit was ****ched high into the sky. Their bodies expl**** and ****tered like ****works.
"Curse you.……
When I was ****rised to see the techn**** for the first time, Sakura ***ked back at me.
"Hmph. I've been taught by a for*** master of the ***lve Masters. As a member of the ****ting department, which is desi**** to fight against human ***chics, it's only natural that I'd be able to ***urn a curse like that.
I could see a glimpse of the old days in his smug expression.
If this is true, then the ***ons who brought out the straw dolls sho*** be punished, but the peo*** who were ****lved in the curse-retur**** are prob**** feeling a ***tle sick, so I'll let it go as an acci**** this time.
And that was when Sakura pul*** out a metal fitting from the ***und.
"Mitsuketa.
Hey!　Sakura!　Watch out!
A second curse spirit - this time simi*** to Kaede - was ****ping up right beh*** Sakura. It's not like the one bef***, it has a ***mal human-sized body, so it was too late to notice its approach.
It was too late for Sakura to return the curse. When I dis***ered the aphrod***** hole in the chest of the curse spirit, I ***hed Sakura away and str*** the curse spirit that resembled Kaede, who was reac**** for me, with the cli*** expulsion.
"What the...? !
The face, which is unnecessarily neat for a curse spirit, is distorted…… in astonishment, and event***** bec***s debauched into mush.
"……Whoa!"? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Huh? ♥ Oho! Oh!
The curse spirit that resembled Kaede was ***king and bre***ing hard, holding her ***tch with both hands as if ***ing to hold back the urge to urinate. I'm not sure what to do, but I'm sure it's a good idea. I'm not sure what to do. But it was a ***ile *****tance.
"Ohhhh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! ♥♥♥♥
BUSHAAH!
The ***sed spirit that resembled Kaede came to an end with a vul*** and lewd voice remini***** of a beast. I'm sure you'll be able to guess what I'm talk*** about.　A lot of water sprays out.　As usual, the water came from ****where. It's a good idea to…… take a look at the details of your own pers**** life.
Are you okay, Sakura!　Are you hurt...? !
The moment I ran up to the che*** blossoms.
My body ***tly spun ***und in the air, and I was slammed into the ***und from ***ind. It was different from the throw I had done earlier. It was a brill**** ***gle-bac*** throw. When I was una*** to move from the ***act that pierced ***ough my body.
"Hey, hey, hey.
Sakura, her whole body ****bling and her face as red as a boi*** octopus, was look*** down at me half cry***. What's wrong with you? 　I'm not sure if it's beca*** you t……?
"Well, I thou*** it would be a good opportunity to see what you're ***able of, so I left the second one in your hands. ……What the hell was that?
What?
Not just a rumor.　It's more than a rumor. ……What is it? 　I can't beli*** it!
Oh, what?　Is it possible that you didn't know the details of the ***max expulsion, Sakura?
I'm not sure what to say.　I'm not sure what to make of this, but I think it's a good idea.
"No, Sakura……, this is a misunderstanding.……
I don't know what the misunderstanding is, but I can't bear to have Sakura look at me like that, so I reach out to her. But Sakura said, "Stay away! and ***ked my hand away.
"You used to say you were going to be a demon hunter like your fos*** father, but I never thou*** you'd be even more of a perve**** demon hunter than your ***ter father.
You're even more perv***ed……?
I really can'……t beli*** it. If you let a guy like you go unchecked, it won't just be the reputation of the associ*****, but our house will……I don't know.
"……Mwah.
As I was being abu*** by Sakura, ****ries of her from back in the day were runn*** thro*** my mind.
The ***rry tree that sha*** her favorite food with me. The che*** blossom that drew a picture of a wedding, saying, "My ***ter father is a priest and my niece is a groom. The che*** blossom…… that recklessly ***ght with Kaede and came to me for consolation.
It……'s a good thing that you were able to protect ……this cute ***tle sister of yours, ……beca*** it ……seems like Sakura was ***ally fine with*** your help.
Furuya-kun, are you okay? 　I've heard that you're being targ**** by a class 4 curse spirit!
I heard Soya's voice in the distance, as if he had heard the commotion, but I didn't have the energy to get up and reply.
It's not okay,…… it'……s mainly ***tal.
　　　　　3
Soya was not the only one who heard the commotion and came.
Next to Soya was Nagumo, who for some reason was holding a limp Karasuma by his side.
"……Damn, what's with the ****mates? They're all prettier than they look in the materials. It's really awful.
See*** the three of them coming towa*** us from afar, Sakura let out a snarl.
No, that was just a coincidence.…… What does it ***ter?
"That's just not a good way to hear peo*** say that all the pretty girls are aro*** a perv***ed ***chic!
As I lay there on the gro***, I asked her about it, and she gave me a theory that I couldn't understand. I didn't have the energy to argue with her. I wanted…… to be ferti***** like this, but I was so limp.
"……Hmm?　Soya?　No!　No, Sakura!　Hide!
He stood up, remembering that Soya had a lecherous eye.
I can't have him ***king at my face!　Just get my ***ket on his face! What?
You're anno****!
When I tried to wrap my jacket aro*** Sakura's face, she bent my joi*** in the opposite direc****. If my joints hurt, my heart hurts.
"Soya's daughter's crazy psyc*** ****ities, right?　That's nothing to be ***aid of if you don't have ****hing to be ***aid of.
I'm sure you'll be able to figure out what's going on.
It's not like I have anything to be ***amed of.…… Well, if you're a che*** blossom, you're pure and natural like that.
Eventually, Soya, Nagumo, and a limp Karasuma arrived here.
"Thank God you're not hurt,……Huh?
Soya sudd**** made a ***ange sound and froze.
He was ***ring at Sakura's face, and for some reason he kept glancing at me.
I was wonde**** if she was confused by the fact that the ***ual information she saw with her whore eyes was so pure and white, when she stepped towa*** Soya and the others.
Nice to meet you. My name is Bunbori Sakura, and I'm from the audi**** department to monitor this pervert. I lived with this guy until about the eighth grade. It's nice to meet you.
Sakura bows to Soya and the others with*** me having to introduce her. But the greeting is ****ngely intimidating. I'm not sure what to make of it.
I don't know. I feel a lit*** alien****, but I don't feel like I can intervene…….
"Oh, by the way, Nagumo. What's wrong with that guy?
I ***ned the water on Nagumo, who was staring at Sakura's body and muttering, "You…… can do it. I've been ****ering about that for a while now, haven't I? Karasuma was limp in Nagumo's arms. I'm very ****eful that he's quiet in front of the ***rry blossoms, but it's weird to see Karasuma, who's alw*** full of energy in the wrong direc****, like this.
"This perverted woman?　I ***ught I saw somet**** that loo*** like a black firework in the sky, and then I sudd**** got sick.
"Hey, Karasuma!　Did you participate in the rituals of those ***ots from D class?
You're just ***eading your curse!　You had me worried!
"Ugh……, beca*** you won't give me your sister.……
It was a total backfire. Go die for a while.
"By the way.
Geez.
And then Sakura, who had been ***king at Soya, ******ctedly stepped in ***ween me and Nagumo.
"It seems like you're pretty good friends with this pervert, is that okay?
Sakura, who has ***ned her back on me to face Soya and the others, emits a voice full of thorns.
"He's a pervert with abili**** like that, and he's on the radar of the auditing department, and the whole school is look*** at him funny.　Wouldn't you norm**** disband the team and *****sider your friendships?
 ……Hey, Sakura. I don't think you're going to tell me that your flamb***** greeting on the stage was ****nded to ***late me or ****thing like that, are you?　You don't really hate me that much, do you?
I'm sorry…….
Then Soya, who had been upset until then, sudd**** ****ined his composure.
"Well, even if you say so. Not only Furuya-kun, but we're orig****ly a bunch of sycophants.
Soya poin*** to his own eyes, and then to Karasuma's head.
Soya then walked over to Sakura.
Besides, Furuya-kun told me that he would stay with me forever. "Besides, Furuya-kun told me that he would go along with me to any extent. So I'm not going to leave you now.
Inspired by Soya's words?
I owe you a favor. I wouldn't leave him just ***ause of that. ……I ***ally found a way to get breast implants.
If I leave the secondhand store, I won't be able to watch the touc**** act***.…………
Nagumo and Karasuma also agr*** with Soya. ……You guys, Soya is saying ****thing that makes me happy, so choose your words a lit*** more.
"Gosh……. I ***ught it was only that vixen that was ……troublesome,…… that even this much intimidation had no effect.
Sakura muttered ****thing in frustr*****.
Anyway!　From now on, make sure the campus team knows not to let that pervert cause any problems!　If he abuses his abili****, we'll purge the whole ……team!
He carried the last of the cardb**** boxes from the moving truck and eas*** clim*** the sta*** of the boys' dormitory.
Oh, hey, Sakura!　I'll help you unpack for your move! Hey!
"I told you not to treat me like a child!　I can do the moving by myself!
He casu**** refused, and I was ****essed again.
I can……'t ***ieve it.
When I was devastated, Soya put his hand on my ****lder with a serious expression on his face.
"You know, Furuya-kun……, I think you sho*** be ***eful about a ……lot of things. Anyway, let's go buy some ***chic security goods.
Hmm?　You mean to warn me about the che*** blossom watch?
You don't need it. There's no way I'm abusing my ***ers.
If only I could keep an eye on Nagumo's out***sts.
"No, I mean...……
As Soya ***ked up at the men's dormitory with an indecisive look on his face, I rece**** a text message on my phone.
It's from Kaede.
"Come alone to the coffee shop in front of the ***tion at ten o'clock tonight. We need to talk.
A coffee shop off campus. Alone.
In the email from Kaede, who took the trouble to specify this, she was clearly aware of Sakura's ****tence…….
Sigh*** that there was no time to rest, I sent a text message back to Kaede.
　　　　　4
In the past, Sakura was a quiet and ****ered child, but there was only one per*** to whom she could bare her passions.
She was Kaede Kuzunoha, who was often brought to the facility by her *****mother.
I don't know if they were incompatible human beings or not, but I've never seen those two get along.
Sakura would call Kaede a "bitch" at every turn, and Kaede, who had ***ays been a ****ible woman, would hang Sakura, who was as cute as a lit*** animal, ***hout mercy. Of course, it was my role to save Sakura from being literally hanged, but in the end, I was hung up by Kaede, and Sakura cried and ***bbed at Kaede.
That's why I've been very careful since I was a child not to let the two of them run into each other.
I thought I instr***** you to come alone. I wonder why this ***tle girl is here.
"What?　Can't you understand that, Kuzunoha-sama?　Of course it's beca*** I'm Furuya Haruhisa's supervisor.
I was talk*** to Mr. Furuya right now, but I don't think the spoiled brat can understand that.
"Who are you to be so careless!　Just like Haruhisa Furuya and you, don't ever treat me like a child!
"'Don't treat me like a child. "'Don't treat me like a child.' Huh. That's what kids always say.
"You can tell even thro*** your clot*** that your boobs are smaller than mine, and you think you're older than me.
"What?
"Oh?
A coffee shop in front of the ***tion.
Sakura, who was sitt*** next to me, immedi***** star*** biting Kaede, who was ***ting in front of me, and my stomach hurt.
I tried to follow Kaede's instructions and sneak out of the dormitory, but ****ever ****nique she used, Sakura sensed my movem**** and accompanied me like this.
The touchy-feely *****phere ***ated by Kaede and Sakura is at a level where the waitress is ****tant to come and take your order.
Somebody help me.
I don't know what's going on. Why are you calling me "Haruhisa Furuya" like that? Why don't you just hide behind your back and call me "big brother" like you used to?
This is…… why conversations with older ***ple are so stressful.
You have a very bad memory……, don't you? I wonder if you've alre*** for***ten that I made you cry so much. I wonder if a pat on your empty head would help you remember a ***tle.
"How long do you think you're superior?　I'll nullify or bounce back all your techn****s. Come on, give it a try. Come on, come on.
"……Well. Now that's what I call a lit*** girl.
Oh, no!　Stop it, you guys!
A ***fire lit up aro*** Kaede, and I stepped in ***ween the two of them just as a white tail ****ared from her lower body. If left unchecked, the coffee shop would disappear.
"Maple wants to talk to me, right?　Then let's just get it over with and be done with it, okay?　See?
"As much as I'd like to, this ***tle bitch is ***ting in my way. Can you ***ase just go away?
You can't just disappear.　I'm Haruhisa Furuya's supervisor. I can't ****look such a suspicious meeting.
You've ……always been ****ssed with Mr. Furuya, haven't you? It's disgusting. You call yourself a watc****, but in real*** you're a stalker with a cause.
What? 　I don't understand why you're s***king me!
Sakura barked, her face ***ning red.
"Mostly!　Kuzunoha Kaede!　I don't want you to say that to me!　It's too suspicious that the heiress of Kuzunoha is ***ing the trouble to perso***** take care of such a perverted ***lity ***hout even ****rting it to the association!　There are many things!
Sakura's face becomes ***der and redder, as if she is remembering the cli*** expulsion ***ing the day. She looks like a boiled octopus.
Kaede, on the other hand, gla*** at me with a cold expression and a ****erous stare. She looks like a hitman.
Did you use your powers in front of this girl?
"No, it's just that Sakura was in danger, and I had no cho***.……
The truth is, he didn't seem to be in any danger at all. ……Well, if he was working, he would have been seen to be capa*** ***ner or later, and it's a matter of sooner or later. So ple*** don't stare at me with such sharp eyes. Even if it's just for the sake of being treated like a pervert by Sakura, it's brea**** my heart. Somebody be nice to me.
"Huh. It's okay. It's too late for me after the mess I made in Shinonome City.
Kaede sighed and ***ned her gaze to Sakura.
And the reason why we didn't ***ort his ***lity to the association was simply beca*** of his pers**** life. Kuzunoha has taken over the wis*** of your ***ter father, who thought it would be difficult for him to live a peaceful life if he had such abilities. Please don't ask any crazy ****tions.
"……Oh, no.
Sakura was frightened for a moment when her fos*** father was quoted. But she quic*** reco***ed.
I don't mean ……to deny the story, but the Audit Department can't just take it on faith. Anyway, as a member of the Audit Department, it is my duty to keep a close eye on Haruhisa Furuya. If you want to talk, please do so here. If you don't have anything to hide, you won't have a problem with me being here.
I ……knew we couldn't talk cal*** with this ***tle girl ***und.
Kaede let out a big sigh again as Sakura tried to fulfill her duties as the auditing department.
I didn't have anything ****rtant to do. It's too much trouble. Furuya-kun, you should go home now.
"What the hell, you ***led me all the way out here.……
While complaining, I had a vague idea of Kaede's purpose. The fact that she wanted to talk to me was just a ploy, and she prob**** wanted to see how far Sakura, who was in charge of monitoring her, would follow her. In the event that you've got a lit*** bit of time, you may want to take a look at a few of the things you can do to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
I was about to leave my seat early, thin****.
You'll have to stay behind for a bit.
Kaede ***led out to Sakura, who was about to leave her seat with me.
What?　Why me? Of course I'm going home with Furuya Haruhisa.
For some reason, Kaede put her mouth close to Sakura's ear, who had a look of pride on her face.
There's ****thing I need to tell you about your abilities, Mr. Furuya.
"……What are you doing?
There's no need to be so cautious. The more information you have, the better, right?　We, Kuzunoha, have no ****ntion of *****onting the Audit Department. We want to share important information.
Why can't we just talk about it right here?
It's ****itive information. I'd like to ***nge the location. Besides, I need to check with my grandm*****, so I need some time. I don't know. If you want, I can tell you about the women ***und Mr. Furuya. I'm sure the relationships of the ***ple you're monitoring are important information.
…………But Haruhisa Furuya is ****hing.
"We'll have a simple ritual to track their movements.
I'm sorry…….
I'm not sure what to make of this, but I'm sure it's a good idea. I didn't want to get ***ght up in the awkward *****phere between the two of them any ***ther, so I didn't pry into it and went back to my ****hing home, but....
●
Ping-pong.
As soon as I got home.
As I was about to cha*** into my loungewear, the intercom sudd**** annou**** a visitor.
I checked the door scope to see if I had a visitor, and an involuntary "What? came out of my mouth.
What are you thin**** coming to the boys' dormitory at this hour?
"Hee hee. No, there's somet**** urg*** that I want to bring to the attention of my senior.
When I ope*** the door, I thought it was a mistake, but it was not a mistake at all. It was TACHIKAWA Mei, a third-year junior in the middle school of the Demon Academy. She wore a ****ishly worn uniform and had a relaxed *****phere that was the ****lete opposite of Kaede. But unusua*** for Mei, who always seems to be relaxed, her breath was coming in gasps as if she had run in a hurry, and her cheeks were ****htly inflamed. Her cheeks were slig**** inflamed. Her cute appea***** was stra***ly glamorous.
"Then you could have called me or somet****. I don't know what peo*** will say if they see you!
I wonder if they'll think I'm a commuter wife.
Idiot!　Just hurry up and get up there!　***ore someone sees you!
Hi.
When I thought about it calmly, it might have been a bad idea to let him in, but it was the only way I could think of to deal with his sudden visit.
Mei walked into my room unguardedly and sat down on my bed in a flow*** manner. I don't have any other place to sit ***ause I'm not ****aring for visitors, but there you go…….
So, what's this all about?
Informant, Mei Tachiikawa.
****ever she comes in ***tact with me, it's usually to bring me some use*** information. However, this is the first time she has sudd**** stormed into my home like this. I braced myself, wonde**** if the information was really bad.
"Well, if you take a look at this ……first...
Mei took her phone out of her pocket. On the screen was an internet news site simi*** to the one Soya had shown her. And what was written on it was once again somet**** about a certain mons***.
"A professional demon sla*** is being atta**** by a pedop**** ***yer……?
****ding at the side of the bed, I read the news content carefully. I also ***yed the wide cut video that was posted with it. ……
'So, that's *****sible. It is said that a large num*** of ****ible cartoons and *****tions that look at young children as sex objects were found in the homes of all the atta**** demons. The Associ***** of Demonologists, which requ**** such a large num*** of miscreants, is ***ing to ****icate the righteous ****ters that are try*** to dest*** them. I'm sure you'll be happy to know that I'm not the only one.
He is still an ****mmon intellectual, but the comments section is full of more supportive ***nions than ever bef***. It's all about shaming *****hiles and the Sorcerer's Association, and lifting up the pedop**** sla***. ……Wow, the word "****phile association" is trending on soc*** media.
No matter how much of a ****phile the other party was, a ***ster that unilaterally ***acks innocent ***ple should not be prote****. But ***ore my indignation, a ****icion arose in me.
"How did the press know about the victim's belongings?　And at home?
That's it.
Mei ans***ed my ques****.
'The association was aware early on about their ***ple being att***ed by ****phile sla***s. They were also ***cerned about public opinion and ***king information. They also ***osed word and spirit restrictions, though not comp****ly, beca*** they didn't have time.
Word restriction. It is a technique that pla*** a special curse on the information itself, prev***ing it from being shared or ***ead.
"I mean this.……
Yes. There is a person who is ***king information ***ide the association. We don't know who he is, but he's defin***** ***lled eno*** to lift a limited num*** of word restrictions.
Doesn't the…… removal of the word restriction mean that you're close to or as good as the Twelve Masters?
The association seems to be quite tense ***ause of the ***ong wind. They're ***king for the culprit behind the leak, and at the same time, they're on the verge of testing the sexua**** of all the demons.
Soya is going…… to be very active. I wonder if he'll get his license for that achievement alone?　It's a special pedop**** demand. I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm sure it's worth it.
That's why. I'm not sure what to do, but I'm sure I'm not the only one. I'm not ……sure what to do, but I'm sure I'll be able to do it.
"You even know about ……Shinonome City?
I was once again embarrassed to think that even Mei knew about this fucking ***lity.
"Yeah, well, I'll be extra careful from now on. Thanks for tak*** the trouble to let me know.
I'm glad to hear you say that. But, you know, ……Mei is very worried.
Mei, who had been sitting on the bed, stood up and came over to me. What is it?
He's raised in a ***rch and has no immunity to the opposite sex. But he's a healthy high school boy, so when he's ***ced, he gets upset. He is full of gaps. You might be forced to use that dange**** ***lity.
"Oh, my God, what do you know?……
Am I thin**** too much? I felt a sense of dread, as if he could see right ***ough me and Nagumo.
In addition, the surveillance offi*** from the auditing department is a cute girl with big boobs. I'm sure you'll be happy to know that I'm not the only one who's a lit*** nervous.
When he said that, I sudd**** ****ized. This guy's boobs have gotten ***ger than the last time I saw him, haven't they?　You'll be able to find a lot more than just a few of these in the marketplace.
"No, no, he's like a sister to me, you don't have to worry about that... Whoa!
It was a fluid surprise. As soon as I felt Mei's soft hands ***und my neck, she fell backwards - towa*** the bed. I'm cau*** up in it, and I'm ***hed down on the bed.
Hey, Mei! 　What the hell do you think you're doing? What are you doing?
I panicked and tried to move away, but Mei twis*** her ***shy legs aro*** me and I couldn't move.
It's not a child's trick like a lap pillow, but a full-fledged exemption for the senior onee-san, Mei thinks. ……And that's ***ctly what I'm ***king about, an immunity so str*** that no other girl can excite me.
You're, uh, you're ***ying too many tricks.
It's not a joke. ……Or is this more to your liking, you ****lent and insensi**** old man?
"What? Oh!
As soon as I thought I was being swatted off my feet, we swit**** bodies, and now I was being pus*** down on the bed. Mei's thighs pinned my thighs together and held them in place.
Maybe it's beca*** of the distance. The dense girl scent ***ring out of me was ***ing my head spin. Mei's hands, which had been ***und my neck, were now ****bing both of my wrists by the bracelets.
I'm not sure what to do. I'm sure you'll be able to understand what I mean. The smooth, warm fingertips ***oked relent****** over and over again on the sensitive skin that was still healing. As my ******ousness was ****rbed by the unkn*** sensa****, my ent*** body was ****loped in a soft sensation.
"The ***ard for this information is the senior onee-san himself.
Mei, who had cove*** my body, whispered seductively in my ear. The hot, moist breath see*** into my skin, and I felt as if my ****onal mind would be taken away.
But then I ****ized ****thing when Mei laid her whole body on top of mine. And I ***ely reg***ed my composure.
"……Mei, you're ……shak***, aren't you?
What?
Maybe you're push*** it.……
"No, of course not!　 ……No, of course not!
No, you're ****ining yourself. Your tone of voice is getting a lit*** stra***.
I *****ciate that you're worried about me, but that doesn't mean you have to push yourself like this...
So, Mei is not overreact***. Let's lead Oniisan-senpai brilliantly.
I'm not sure if you've seen this bef***, but I've seen it before. You're ***ing to cover it up, but your face is all red," she ……said, and that's when my face started to heat up.
"Oh...
Mei, who had been ***ing with a bri*** red face, sudd**** ***ned her head in the ****ction of the day after tomorrow.
"……Damn. It's earlier than I thought, but I guess you could say it's nice timing.
Muttering ****thing, Mei pul*** away from me and adjusted her *****veled uniform.
I'll be back. I'm sure you'll be happy to know that I'm not the only one who has a problem with this.
"You're kidding me.……
I'm a high school boy ***ing alone, for crying out loud.
Oh, and by the way. The Audit Department is also involved in this information. You can't tell any*** that you're here today, beca*** it would be bad if they found out that you ***ked information related to the auditing department.
Mei told her one-sidedly and left the room quic***. She was like a stormy junior.
"Oh, for fuck's sake.……
I don't know how serious he is, but I don't like it when he makes fun of me like that. I'm aware that I have strangely less ***ire in that direc**** than other men of my generation, but it doesn't mean that I don't have any, either.
I was ****king of surf*** the Inte**** on the comp**** provided in the room to calm my mind.
Do-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah!　Doggone it!
Hey, Haruhisa Furuya!
"Whoa! 　What the hell? What?
As soon as I thought I heard a treme***** sound of footsteps, the door, which I had apparently forgotten to lock, was blown open with such force that it see*** to blow away. It was Sakura who strode in with*** hesitation……eyes ***zed with anger, and her blood-colored lips were ***sted like a beast with fangs. I'm not sure what to do. I'm not sure what's going on here.
That woman didn't come here? No.
"Oh, that woman?
Of course it's Maple Kuzunoha!　She didn't show up at the rende***** point for any length of time, so I came back here to see if it was possible!
I don't know why you're here at all, but Kaede's not here ……anyway.
The regu*** checkup was done last time, and there was no reason for Kaede to come here.
"An no-good vixen……. So you're saying you only called me to harass me?　That woman has been aro*** for a very long time!　Show me ****thing sometime,………… huh?
I'm sure you'll be able to understand what I'm talking about.
And then, just as I was thinking that, he moved his small, cute nose in a swooshing motion.
"Hey. Doesn't this room smell like a woman?　And it smells like somet**** I don't know.
"What? What?
What is that super sense? 　I'm sure you're not the only one.
In spite of my confusion, Sakura first nuzzled her face into the bed, then pul*** her face to my chest and sniffed me. Then she tight**** her arms ***und my chest and came at me with a ****ight face and dila*** pupils.
Don'……t tell me you brought in anot*** girl while I was out of sight……?
No, no!　It's a misunderstanding!　It's not like that. No!
Spit it out!　Who were you brin**** in and what were you doing, you pervert!
After that.
I had to end*** an hour-long arthroscopic hell and a two-hour search of my house to cover up what had hap***ed to Mei. My body and mind were torn to shreds, and the next day I kept ***ling asleep in class, and the teacher kept yelling at me.
　　　　　5
"Whoo!　What's going on here!
I mana*** to get ***ough the morning classes and went out with Soya and Karasuma to look for *****hiles in the afternoon.
As usual, we were ***king for a pedop**** aro*** Harugahara station, but after walking ***und for a while, Soya started ****aming his head off. A large ribbon ****nkled and bounced.
'Just when you thought you'd ***ally found a real pedop****, you ……find one too many!　I don't know who I'm ****osed to be ****owing with this!
Just a few minutes ago, I was thinking, "I found him!　If we follow that guy, event***** the pedop**** sla*** will come to ***ack us!　Let's get him back! But as time went by, he began to look twice at peo*** on the str***, and now he was in this state.
"Are there really that many of them?　I couldn't find any until just now.
You can't help it if you say so. I wonder if it has ……something to do with the day of the week or something. It's not ……like there's a sudden increase.
Soya twis*** his head in wonder.
If there are so many pedop*****, why don't we just pick the ones that look the worst and follow them?
"Hmm, I…… don't know. I'm not sure…… what to make of it……, but I think it's a good idea.
It's a hellish picture. There's only bad guys here.
Well, it seems that men's sex*** habits are not only pedop****s but also a lot of other dange**** ones.
"Damn it!　The mission isn't going well, I'm being watched all the time, I'm cramped, and it's just so bad!
Soya ***ked back while lightly stomping on the ***und.
From the cor*** of his eye, he saw the ***rry blossoms ****ding in with the hustle and bustle.
Sakura, the watcher, is not only in class, but she is also watching us, or rather me, dur*** work. After work, she goes home to the dormitory with me, and I feel like I'm with her all the time except when I go to bed. I'm glad to be back in the old days, but Sakura's ****tude is so harsh that I feel a hole in my stomach…….
"Ughhh. Somet**** is bothe**** me. Ever since Sakura-chan came, I've been both**** by it!
Soya was ***bing his cheeks and wriggling aro***. The other day, he ***ked like he wasn't feeling well, but I wonder if he went to the ****ital ***perly.
"Hmmm. Looks like this is where I come in.
Karasuma sizzles. He ***oled and loo*** back at Sakura.
If you find the surveillance annoying, there's only one thing you can do. "If you find the surveillance annoying, there's only one thing to do: embrace it!　Literally!　Sexually!
He said, and Karasuma started to charge towa*** Sakura.
Aoi-chan! 　What are you doing with the Audit Department?　You can't leave me alone! I'm sorry.
"Oh, leave him alone, leave him alone. Karasuma will be more ***ure once he's been hurt.
Sure ***ugh, a few ***onds later, Karasuma's scream erupted, ****owed by Sakura's cursing, "What the hell is this? Soya hurried to intervene. Soya ****iedly intervened and apologized to Sakura while stic**** his ***gers in Karasuma's ears, who was half-cocked from the joint. I can'……t keep up with you.
It was when I was ***king at the crowd, thinking that I was too lazy to go all the way to Soya and the others who were attracting attention.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Suddenly, a young girl in a red one-piece dress came into view and fell down with great force. I couldn't help but shout out as I saw her fall so beautifully.
"……Ew.
The girl sits up and sta*** ***king her head.
Oh my God, what are my pare*** doing?……
Hey, are you okay?
"Bewitched.
I couldn't help it, so I ***ched out to her, and the lit*** girl was blatantly alarmed. It's kind of hurtful…….
The lit*** girl ***ked up at me half-heartedly with a wary look, but then opened her mouth.
"……Are you a ****phile, young man?
No, no, no, no!
If you call out to a child who has fallen, you are treated as a pedop****.……
I'm glad you're not.
With a ***tle lisp, the lit*** girl took my hand and stood up.
That's when it happ****.
with a thump
"……?
A sensation of something like an electric curr*** ***hing thro*** my hands, head and groin. But the strange sensation soon fades away.
Is it my imagination?　I'm more worried about the girl right now.
"Are you okay?　Do you have any pain?
"Yes, sir. Thank you.
Apparently, I was lucky enough not to get hurt. She had a cute smile on her face with not a sin*** scratch on her fake ***king face.
Where are your parents?　If they're lost, I'll come with you to look for them.
"Don't worry. I'll be right here.
When I said that, the lit*** girl ***pped back and *****peared into the crowd as if she was runn*** away.
I don't know. Does he hate me?
There seems to be a lot of ****philes ***und here, and I wanted to take care of him until he met up with his parents, but ……well, it seems that no one actually ***ses with him, and if I go after him here, I'm the pedop****.
"Cherry blossoms ……used to be pretty like that...
Looking back at Sakura, Karasuma and the others who were still ***ping away in the back, I couldn't help but think about something sterile.
In the end, we had no luck with the ****phile sla*** that day either, and we broke up rather early.
Haruhisa Furuya. You look tired, but you should at least eat a pro*** meal!
In front of the doors of rooms 406 and 407.
Sakura, who lives in the room next to mine, gave me a disgu**** look and disappe**** into her room. Who do you think is ***ing you tired?……
When I re***ned to my dorm room, I couldn't even find the energy to ***nge my clot*** and fell into bed.
It's too much trouble now, so I'll just go to bed. Sakura told me to eat at least a proper meal, but I should have ***pped by a convenience store on my way ……home.
While I was thinking about this, my ******ousness became cloudy...
Mr. Furuya!　Mr. Haruhisa Furuya!　No, no!　Attention, lower body!
What the hell?
It was the voice that I hadn't heard for a while. It was the voice of a girl that I have been ***ring in my dre*** since I was bewitched by the curse of ***max expulsion.
Oh, I'm vaguely aware ……that I'm hear*** that voice in my dream for the first time in a long time.
But the dream I had after a long time was different from the usual one.
Mr. Furuya!　Are you listening to me?
Whoa!
In the white ****scape that loo*** like an endless sea of clouds, there was something *****iliar.
A girl was ****ting in the air, staring at me.
Brown skin, silver hair, golden eyes with a light that is clearly not from a person. A strange tail whose tip looks like a heart mark.
She was wearing a nun's uniform. However, ***haps it was the short length, or perh*** it was the femi**** lines of her ample ***asts and buttocks, but the nun's uniform, which was meant to show her chastity, had ***ned into a compl***** dirty ***tume.
She has a *****rious appea***** that is both bewit***** and yet cute, which makes you fall in love with her. She had an atmosphere that ****nded me of a demon, and desp*** her supernatural appearance, she had a ****erate look on her face.
I'm trying to stop it, but I can't do it forever!　Hurry up and bring the lower half of your body back to sanity!
Why don't you come to your senses first?　What do you mean, "sanity in the lower half of my body"?
The brown girl's voice tweaked me in my hazy conscio******.
But the girl's voice was getting fain*** and fainter, as if her ******ousness was beginning to awaken...
"……What was that dream?
Bef*** I knew it, dawn had broken.
As soon as I woke up from the bed, I felt my ******ousness awake. Then I thought back to the dream I had just had and furr**** my brow.
The voice…… was the same as always, I can't remember what it said, so that's okay.……
I think I vaguely saw a girl…….
It was just a ***ture of mult**** dreams, and maybe the ***max expulsion had nothing to do with the girl's appearance. But.
"Notify me immedi***** if there is any cha*** in the cli*** expulsion.
*****bering what Kaede had reminded me, I grabbed my phone desp*** the early morning.
But the next moment, my mind was blown away from the strange dream.
"……What?
I ***ned on my phone, and what I saw was a skin tone that ***ered the ***ire screen.
The image on my lock screen had chan*** to that of a nude young girl with a bandage covering her ****ates - and for some reason, I couldn't take my eyes off that image at all.
Chapter 3: I'm Still Not a ****phile
　　　　　1
"What……? What the hell?
It wasn't just my phone's lock screen that was going crazy.
The ****paper is a puffy lit*** girl in a school swimsuit.
In the image folder, there are ****reds of ***ges of two-dimensional young girls in a variety of sex*** states.
Bef*** I knew it, a myste***** app called "Lolicon Go!" had been ****alled on my home screen, and I had ***eady capt**** quite a few lit*** girls. What's with the "buddy ***tle girl" system? ……Why does it level up when you take a lit*** girl ***und……?
I don't get it. Is ……someone playing a prank on me?
When I ***ted up my ****uter, I found the same devastation as on my phone.
The wallp**** is an image of a lit*** girl eating a banana. I have doz*** of ****phile sites in my ****marks bar, and I like every loli illust****** on ******ration sites. I've clicked "……Like!　That's not good!　It's not good!
Someone's playing a prank?　A conspiracy?　Or harassment?
There was no way I would have done this, and I had no memory of doing it, so it was natural to ass*** that a third party had done it for some purpose. But...
Why can't you turn it ……off……?
My hand stops when I try to cha*** the wallpaper on my phone or ****uter. My fingertips ***eze when I try to ***ete a saved image. My phone slips out of my hand when I try to uninstall "Pedophile GO!
And almost ***hout my will, my eyes were drawn to the loli image on their own.
For example, when a man sees a skirt about to be lifted up, or a pair of big ***asts with their bos*** wide open, his gaze is drawn to them almost reflexively, regar***** of his *****tions.
And now, for some reason, I was having that reflex act*** against the loli image.
And it's pretty intense. Intense. It ****umes my mental energy to look away from each loli image, and just when I think I'm done, my eyes are drawn to the next loli image.
"No way, seriously, did I do that?　All this loli image collecting, ******ciously?
It's impossible. Because I'm not a pedop****.
You have to be at least a junior high school student, prefe***** a ****smate or older, to be seen as such an object.
But then, what…… the hell is this?
Could it be that the ***ire for loli, which had been *******ciously *****essed until now, ****enly arose?
If that's the case, then ……I'm a pedop**** with the ***lity to expel climax. It's not just bad hearing. I can't ***end this combination.
"And anyway. If peo*** knew I was saving all this stuff, my life would be over.……
I did my best to erase the ***ges and favorite sites ***red on my computer and phone one by one, ……but it see*** that a lot of time had passed before I could erase even 10% of them.
Hey, Haruhisa Furuya!　Are you still sleeping? 　It's ***eady school time!
Aah!
Sakura, the watcher, ***cked on the door and urged me to go to school ***hout mercy.
Damn it!　Why do I have to ***end so much mental energy to delete a picture?
It's no use. I'm going to change the wallpaper on my phone and computer, and set up a pass**** so that others can't see what's inside, just to buy some time.
This must be some kind of mistake. I'm not a ****phile, so I'm sure I'll be back to nor*** in no time. That's right. As long as the ***ple aro*** me don't find out about this perverted colle***** until then, there's no problem...
Oh.
Whore's eyes.
My face instantly paled as I *****bered the unbelievable abilities of my *****mates who were on the team.
No, no, no, wait, wait. You know what Soya said to me when I confronted Sakura. I'm not going to leave you now. That's why it……'s ***ally acceptable.
"Aren't you the one who's a pedop****, Furuya?
No, that sounds too harsh. 　I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm sure it's a good idea.
I…… don't know what I'm going to do.
My impat**** mind couldn't come up with a good idea, so I walked to school with Sakura, terrified of batt**** with Soya.
●
As soon as the morning class was over, I went ****ight to the bath**** in the opposite ****ction of B class where Soya was enrol***.
Haruhisa Furuya!　What are you trying to do to get away from me? What are you trying to do?
Sakura, who was taking a class with me in D class, shou*** and ***sed after me. Kobayashi, Karasuma and the others saw this and said, "Yeah, don't run away! "Set meal disposal bastard! "Ball-less pervert! and "ball-less perv!" and other *****erent ***sive language. They've been hurt by the return of the curse, but they have no remorse!
What do you mean? It's just a toilet.…… Don't get confused.
I evacuated to a ***vate room with Sakura grumbling in the backgro*** and called Soya.
"Huh?　What's wrong, Furuya-kun?　We're working together this afternoon anyway, so why ***her calling?
"Oh, yeah. That's the thing, though.
"What?
"I'm look*** for a ****phile in Harugahara, why don't we patrol separ***** today?
"Separately?
"See, you said it yourself.　There are so many pedop***** that it's hard to know who to follow. If that's the case, it would be more efficient if we split into two groups!　Besides, you said that being watched by Sakura was uncomfortable, right?　The only one Sakura is watching is me, and I think Soya will be less bur***ed if we go our ****rate ways.
"What?　Well, yeah, I guess you could say that.……
It was an excuse he had *****ically concocted ***ing class.
To be honest, it's a pretty unreasonable theory, so I'm just going to go with the flow.
Also, I've got some urgent business to attend to today, so I want Harugahara to go ahead with Soya and Karasuma.
Oh, really?　Then let's decide on a place to meet up first.
Oh no, that's a bit inefficient too, isn't it?　I'll keep an eye out for that pedop****. I'll keep an eye on that ****phile, the conspi***** one who was parading ***und in a fla*** costume to adver**** the store. If I can't find him, I'll meet up with Soya and ask him to tell me which ****phile to follow.
"Yeah, that's fine, but…… isn't there something strange about you today, Mr. Furuya?
Geez.
"It's all in my head! It's all in my head!　Well, that's it for today, then.
I told him and hung up the phone. ……I was pretty suspicious, but I was okay, right?
　　　　　2
I was able to make it thro*** the day ***hout see*** Soya.
"Damn it, why? 　I can'……t get over being a ****phile at all.
Lunch break the next day. I was in a ***vate room in the men's rest**** with my head in my hands.
I had thought that a day or so would help, but I was naive.
There was no way that his ***ual proclivities, once opened to him, were going to go away so easily.
Yesterday, I almost had a cou*** of accidents because my eyes were loc*** on a lit*** girl walking down the street, and when I woke up this morning, the ***ber of secon**** lolita ***ges on my phone and computer had doubled. I woke up this morning to find that the num*** of ima*** of secon**** lolita on my phone and computer had doubled, and I had even paid for "Lolicon Go! I don't know why this game hasn't been suspended.
Even now, I find myself *****sciously picking up my phone and idly browsing ****ndary lolita sites.
"Gosh. I'm not a pedop****. ……I'm not a pedop****.……
I don't think my mind is craving for loli, but my hands are moving on their own. I'm not addi**** to my phone, I'm addi**** to lolita. No matter how I think about it, it's bad. I'm crazy. I'm crazy.
The most frightening part was when I real**** that I didn't feel nervous at all when I *****bered the scene where Kaede was giving me a ***ular checkup.
"Hey, hey. Haruhisa Furuya. Haven't you been acting strange since yesterday?　Today you went stra**** to the bathroom dur*** all the breaks. You should put yourself in my shoes standing in front of the men's room.
Sakura called out to me from the entrance of the bathroom, but I didn't care.
It's just not right, is it?……
I sent a text message to Soya saying, "Sorry, I have something to do again today. After send*** a text message to Soya saying, "I'm sorry, but I've got something to do again today.
Hypothetically. By any chance. Even if I'm wrong and the abominable ****phile gene is still ***mant in me. No matter how hard I try, I doubt that my taste will change so dramatically in just one night.
When a sexua**** opens up, there must be a str*** trigger. Have you had such a dramatic *****ience with loli recently……?　I was searching my memory.
"……It would be suspicious if we proposed to be *****etely separated for two days in a row.
The phone that was displaying the secondary lolita image shuddered, signa**** an ****ming call from Soya.
I picked up the phone, trying to figure out how to excuse myself.
"Oh, Mr. Furuya?
……What?　Hmm? 　Soya?　What's going on?
Soya's always chee**** voice sank to the floor, and I was surprised to hear it.
I haven't heard Soya's voice like this since he was half pout***, "The team is ***eady broken up? Soya's voice hadn't ***nded like this since he had half-sobbed.
"Furuya-kun, are you avoiding me ***ehow?
What?
"Did I do something to make Mr. Furuya hate me?
"No, you idiot, I don't!
If he is recog***** as a ****phile, it will be the end…… of him ****ally. Perhaps he feels gui*** for negle***** Soya for reas*** simi*** to self-defense.
I don't know why I get so flustered when I hear Soya's ***len voice.
No, not at all. It's compl***** our fault. It's not Soya's fault!
What's wrong is my body, which is ****ishly ***king out loli.
"Really?
It's true. It's *****itely not Soya's fault.
When I stro**** assu*** him, Soya let out a relieved voice, "I'm glad.
I was relieved to hear her voice, which had been sinking, return to its original chee**** tone.
But that was the next moment.
"I'll change the question then, okay?
I felt the tone of Soya's voice ****enly drop.
"Mr. Furuya, have you cros*** the line with Cherry Blossom?
 What's?
"Soya?　What the hell are you saying out of the blue?　Are you okay?
It's nothing out of the ordi****. The more time you spend with a whore's eye, the more you can learn about things ***hout ***king directly at them.
Soya rambled on in a strangely flat tone.
"For example, you know what?　I'm not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing.　It's usually the case that the person has suddenly ****loped a strange sexuality or has cros*** the line with someone else.
Number one!　The best!　The answer is num*** one, 'I've suddenly devel**** a strange sexual habit'!　But I can't say that, so I can't help it!
"Hey, did you cross the line with Sakura?　Isn't that why you're having trouble ***ing me?　What do you think?　If not, you can meet me right now, right?　Where are you?　You'……re not in D class, are you?
Wait, wait, wait, wait!　What the hell is wrong with you?
Soya's assaulting D class while on the phone?
Calm down, Soya!　Okay?　I've told you before that she's like a sister to me!
"So you're saying that you're an incestuous sissy who crosses the line with someone you think is your sister?
"Stop assuming that you must have crossed a line!　I think of him like a real brother and sister, and I've never ***ked at him that way!
"……Sakura-chan doesn't seem to think so, though, does she?
"Well, he hates me a lot now. He doesn't even call me big brother. He doesn't even call me big brother. See?
"……That's not what I meant.
I'm sure you'll be able to understand what I'm talking about.
Anyway!　It's not true that I crossed the line with Sakura!
I'm sure you're not the only one.
Hmm?
Why are there more ****kely ***ions out there!
"Furuya, you've been having naughty dreams about Kuzunoha-san. You often look at Kuzunoha-san's arms. It seems that you often see her at the regu*** ****kups for climax elimination. ……You call her by her first name.
You've got too lit*** to go on!
I'm sure you'll be able to find something that will help you out.
I'm sure you're not the only one.
………………………………………No, that's just something I had to do.
At the very least, we…… need to wipe out the perverted lolicon *****ction, or at least see how much Soya is ***ling to tolerate about lolicon.
"A……
Hearing my ***rred words, Soya suddenly fell silent.
"If you're ****ning to do that, I have an idea.
Two-two-two. The phone went dead.
"What's the idea?……
I have a ***rce bad feeling about this.
I don't know what Soya is plan**** to do, but it's not a good idea to be on campus. You never know when and where you might bump into Soya. I'm not sure what to do, but I'm sure I'm not the only one. I'm sure you'll be able to find something that works for you. I'm not sure what to do.
I ran out of the bathroom.
"Hey, Haruhisa Furuya. Where do you think you're going in such a hurry?
I don't know!　I'm ***ning out of the school anyway!
"What?　What's that? What's really happened to you since yesterday?
After ***ning for a while tow*** the entrance, Sakura ***ehow stood in the direction I was going.
You're not hid*** something from me, are you?
Aren't there too many peo*** aro*** me who have good intuition?
It's nothing!　Anyway, I've got to get out of school as soon as possible.
"That's what you'll be doing ……again.
What?
Am I still so unreliable?　I've done a lot of ****ning and I've built up my ***lls. I've trained a lot, I've gotten good at it, and now I can ***pete with that fox on equal terms. I can do everything on my own, even ****ework and studying. I can even help you if you are cursed like I was with the curse spirit.
Why?
Sakura didn't yell at me, nor did she turn hostile.
He sta*** at me with a *****rated voice and a tearful look on his face.
Sakura?　What are you talking about……?
Puzzled by the suddenness of the situation, he suddenly felt a ***nge at the word "curse" that Sakura had ***tioned.
Curses. It's not just about forcibly activ***** crazy abilities like my climax expulsion or Soya's lecherous eyes, it's also a general term for ****itual phenomena and techniques that have a nega**** imp*** on the target's health, cognitive abilities, and even their fortune and relationships.
It was a time when I was preoccupied with every event…… and my own hang-ups.
"Huh?　That's Furuya. What are you doing here?
From across the hallway, a group of boys from D class walked up to me.
The three of them, led by Kobayashi, who was drin**** 100% mother's milk juice, *****ached me with a rather friendly expression.
I saw Misaki-chan in D class earlier, do you have to go?
No, that's not quite right.
Slur**** my words, I gradu**** moved away from Kobayashi and the others.
Because it's not right.
There was no way these guys were going to approach me with such a refreshing smile on their faces.
 ……I'll give it a try.
Tëm, no!
Aah!　He's getting away!　Get him!　Go, go, go!
Contact Team B!　Furuya's ***eing in the direction of the gymna**** from the 2nd lab on the 2nd floor of the west wing!　Anyone who can pass ***ough the phys**** barr***, go aro*** and seal off the exits!　Don't let him esc***!
I knew it!
Haruhisa Furuya!　What the hell is this? 　What's going on? 　Did you do something wrong? What's going on?
Sakura, who had been ***ning along**** me at full speed with no time to spare, shou*** in confusion.
　　　　　3
Wait, secondhand store!　We're friends, right? 　We're your friends!
"Shut the fuck up!　You're not my friends!
Please!　Misaki promised me that if I could get you, she'd introduce me to a girl whose sexuality is the best match for me!
I knew Soya was behind this!
"Don't look at me like that, lit*** girl.　If…… you don't cooperate, I'll tell every girl in the school about your sexuality.
Soya's a demon!　Soya's been abusing his powers more than I have!
I'm not gonna let them get me!
Why is that big-breasted bitch trying to get you? 　She even used a man!　If it comes to it, I'll be there to keep an eye on you.……
Wait, wait, wait!　For God's sake, wait a minute!
I hurriedly stop*** Sakura, who was ***ning with me, from taking out a talisman that ***med to be used for capture.
I don't know what it is, but Soya thinks that you and I have crossed the line!　That's why he's trying to see me!
What? 　Why are you and I together?　Aren't you crazy? 　Are you crazy? What?
I'm not sure what to make of this. I'm not sure what to do. I……'m not sure what to do.
"Huh?　But then why are you runn*** away? It's a misunderstanding, there's no need to run away.
"……Well, that's...
"No ……way, did…… you really cross the line with that fox?
"That's it!　Why am I supp**** to cross the line with Kaede?
You're the most unlikely opponent!
Then why are you running away?
Sakura gla*** up at me with half-lidded eyes. I'm not sure what to do, but I'm sure I'll be able to do it.
I have no cho***. It's much better than being a pedop**** and still have…… a good excuse.
……Actually, I had an extre**** erotic dream about Soya the other day, and it's hard for me to face him.
"Expose me to death, you pervert!
"Oh, no! 
In the face!　You can't gouge me in the face, Sakura!
……But, hmmm, that big-breasted bitch, she's got it all wrong.
What is it?　I'm ……sure you're not the only one.
"All right, all right. I'm going to help you.
What?
"Don't get me wrong. It's not that I want to prolong her misunderstanding, it's just that it's natural for the auditing department to stop her from using her spiri**** power in an illegal way to get you!
I'm not sure what it is, but if the che*** blossoms are on my side now, I'm all set.
As I was running, thinking that I should do something to thank him, something ***ght my foot.
Baboom!
"What? What?
It was an instantaneous event. The next thing I knew, Sakura and I were tied up in a rough rope and suspended in midair. And this is a ……turtle shell bondage?
"What the hell is this?　Who would set…… such a crazy wire trap?
Sakura's face tur*** bri*** red and she squirmed. The rope was ***ging into her, and she was leak*** strange noises.
There's only one person I can think of who would set such a shit trap.
"Ssshhhhh. Hahahahahaha!　Not only Furuya, but even Miss Sakura was caught!　How *****itous!
As ****cted, it was Karasuma who ***rged from the shadows of the school buil**** with a high-pitched laugh.
"How does my turtle-bound wire trap taste?　It's worth the time and effort I put into making it.
This guy really lear*** a lot of useless ski*** for exorcism!
"Ahhh. I can't take it any ……longer! The rough rope I've wor*** so hard on is digging into Miss Sakura's cro***!　I want my hands to dig in even more!　Show me more of that *****rated face!
"You perverted bitch……! Don't underestimate the Audit Department!
Whack.
The rope that had bound Sakura came undone and she ***ded on the ***und with a swoosh.
Monstrous?　No, that was...
"Knife…… in the works"……?
"That's too bad. This impro***** trap won't work on the Audit Department.
Sakura puts her blade in my rope as well, saying forcefully to the aston***** Karasuma.
Sorry, Sakura. Thank you.
"Hmmm, can I count on you?
The cherry blossoms seem to be very proud of themselves. This kind of thing is very cute and reminds me of the past.
"Well, it seems that Miss Sakura is in the way of ****hing the secondhand store.……
"Huh? Huh?
A shock that was even grea*** than the turtle-bound wire trap hit Sakura and me.
Karasuma activated his technique and a rope of light appeared in front of Sakura's eyes.
It is against the rules to fire a jutsu at a person when it is not necessary for exorcism.
Moreover, invoking a technique against an audi*** is like going to rob a ***ice station.
"Karasuma, what are you really doing? What are you doing?
Karasuma responded to my call with a tight smile.
"Huh, huh, huh. Miss Misaki said to me. She said…… that if she could get Haruhisa Furuya, she would be willing to tie Miss Misaki up just once, not knowing what would happen to her once she was tied up.……　I'll do ****ever it takes to get Furuya!　 ……I don't ……think it's a good idea to use magic on the Audit Department, ……but Miss Misaki is willing to let me tie her up…….
You're crazy!
No, Karasuma's not the only one, but the most dange**** one is Soya. I'm not going to let him get away with it.　I'm not sure what's going to make him do that.
Haruhisa Furuya!　That perverted woman's eyes are insane! 　Isn't she under some kind of ******ashing spell? What?
Yeah, well, he's usually insane, you know?
In any case, you've got a lot of nerve showing off your skills against an audi***.……
The boys of class D, hurry up……!　While I'm *****olling Miss Sakura, I'll get the secondhand store and bring…… the rosy school sex life to our hands.
Karasuma suddenly reve****.
Karasuma, ***pite his "S" temperament, is not easily beaten. He must have been ****ated by the deadly energy ***tted from the cherry blossoms and the pres**** of doing something ****erous to the ***itor.
Someone please do something about this peeky pervert…….
"What the hell was that? ……Damn it. This pervert is eating up all my time.
I ***ked down the hallway and saw Kobayashi and the other boys who had originally been chas*** us, and many others crow**** in from both sides. We could hear them coming from the bot*** of the sta***, and if we loo*** out the window, we could see even more boys ***hing ***ards us.
You can't get away with this, can…… you?
I don't know, how many peo*** did Soya get?　I can't beli*** his persistence.……
When this happens, it's uphill.
"Up?
I had almost given up on the idea, when Sakura muttered *****essly next to me.
It was on the roof*** that Sakura and I ran as if we were trap***.
There he is!　You're gonna get yourself killed! You're the one with all the girls! If only Misaki could have you, we'd have…… spring.
Soya-inspired walkers rus*** ***ard me.
"Hey, Sakura!　Are you sure you're okay? Are you sure?
"Just shut up. Just shut up and watch.
I'll be back.
At that moment, Sakura put the metal clasp on the ground of the rooftop and made a mark.
"What the hell? What?
The boys ***ped into an invisible wall and scre**** like squashed frogs. A circ**** ward surrounded the stairs lead*** to the rooftop.
"What the hell? What the hell?
Hey, someone break the wards!
Some of the boys, perh*** from Class C and above, took out their ****smans and threw them at the wards.
But the ward*** didn't falter, and Sakura took out four more talis**** with a relaxed expression.
"Here. It's for messengers with less than one spirit level.
With a bang, the talisman changed, and what appeared were four white birds. They spread their wings and some*** grabbed me by the shoulders and head.
"Uh, this can't…… be right.
Get out of there.
Sakura pointed to the other side of the rooftop fence.
No, no, no, no!
Are you serious? 　It's ****erous, and the boys who saw us interacting have ***eady ***ned ***und and are waiting for us from below!
They'll be fine. They're pretty str***. None of them will be able to get out of this school.
"What?
I put up a phys**** barrier aro*** the ent*** buil****. The students should be able to hold out for a while against these num***s.
The level of growth of my sister is a lit*** scary.
But... I'm not sure what to do, but I'm sure you'll do fine. Come on, let's go!
"Wait, I'm not ready for this! Aah!
I was thrown away by the cherry blossoms, caught in midair by the birds, and somehow ***ded safely on the ground.
"The cherry blossom guy is reckless, ……but it's helped.
It took me a few minutes of running to shake off my pursuers. Somehow, I mana*** to escape from the Demon Academy ***hout encountering any other pursuers. All I had to do was get over that wall and I'd be off campus.
I…… don't know where to go from here.
We knew exactly where we had to go. Harugahara.
When I heard the word "curse" from Sakura, I was aware of one possibility. The reason why I had suddenly started to act like a ****phile.
I'm…… going to erase all the loli ima*** from my phone and then talk to Sakura about it. Sakura's suddenly been very cooperative.
They might even listen to a ridic***** hypothesis that sounds like an excuse for a pedop****.
That was when I put my hand on the wall, thinking about it.
Boom!
"What? What?
The fence right next to me blew down with a roar.
"What the hell? What?
I hurried to distance myself from the wall.
What emerged from the shadows of the fence was a huge piece of metal.
I wond**** where he had been hiding until then. A jet-black armor that must have been three met*** tall. His longsword was even larger than his hei***. A red light twinkled like an eye from the gap in the hel*** that ***ered his ***ire face, and he was ***king down at me.
Then, in a muddy voice that made it difficult to distinguish between men and women, he said, "I'm sure.
"Pedophiles must…… be ……destroyed.
 ……Hey, don't tell me this guy's a ****phile ……***yer?
　　　　　4
Gosh!
"Geez! Aah!
What was swung at me was a huge longsword that was more like a lump of iron than a blade.
I ***ely avoided a direct hit, but the ground where the sword had swung down ****oded, and a huge amo*** of earth and sand hit me.
The ****ntum of the earth and sand pus*** me to roll over and over on the ground.
I quickly removed the bracelets from my hands. Both of my hands started to become inhuman, and my vision gradually changed from what it ***mally is. But it would still take some time before I could use the climax expulsion.
Gasp, gasp.
"Pedophile……. Must…… disappear.
DOGGOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
The armo*** giant, which showed agility despite its massive appearance, came ****ight at me and swung his sword down again. The ground exploded. The aftermath alone rip*** my ent*** body to shreds.
Oh, shit!
I ran. I ***ned back the way I had just come as fast as I could. I couldn't go out into the city with this ***ster in tow.
"Of all the things you could have done, why did you come out at this time? 　And you're ****eting me!
You make it sound like I'm a real ****phile!
 ……Oh, I get it!　This guy is actually some kind of mons*** ****uised as a ****phile ***yer, right? 　Because I'm not a pedop****!
I was just about to be convi**** of a very ***ical conclusion by myself.
Gasp, gasp.
The sound of armor looms just behind me. Then, boom. The sound of a huge mass cutting ***ough the wind.
"Whoa! Whoa!
The longsword, which is as tall as the armo*** giant, ***shes ****ways. It was swung out with *****ndous speed.
You can't ……dodge this! No!
Reflexively, he shielded his torso with both arms.
The two arms that have been *****etely ****nized catch the longsword just in time, but…….
"Aaahhhh! !
A tremendous shock hit me all over. Perhaps it was because I was using a weapon, but the blow was heavier than the one that had hit the breast-avoiding woman. I couldn't hold on at all, and I was blown away.
"Ugh, gosh.
I rolled ***und on the ground like a rag. When I loo*** ***und with my bar*** ***aining ******ousness, I saw that I was on the practice field of the Demon Academy. How many ***ers was I blown away?……
What?　Isn't that a second-hand store? "Isn't that Furuya?
Hey, guys!　There's Furuya, get him!　 ……Why is that guy so battered?
The boys, who must have been ****tered ***oughout the school to look for me, came running tow***s me.
You idiots!　Get out of here!　Get out of here!
At about the same time, a boy who see*** to be in a higher class came running towards us with a first aid charm in his hand and a boy in D class with a rope in his hand.
Gashan gashan gashan gashan gashan.
"Pedophile must…… be ……exterminated.
An ***ored giant appro***** me from the direction I'd been blown from, with large strides.
"What the hell is that thing, a……? What the hell?
We're on campus! 　Where the fuck did you come from? Where did you come from?
The boys who did the psyc*** detection ***ght and drag*** me away from the armo*** gia***.
But my opponent's legs are fas*** than they look!
"Hexa**** mult**** warding!
Just before they catch up with us. The boys of the upper class, who had gath**** after hearing the commotion, threw protective charms and activated an improvised ward. The armo*** ***nts hit the wall and stop*** for a moment, but
"Pedophiles must…… be ……exterminated.
Gosh!　The longsword ***sed the warding like a piece of paper.
However, the reaction of the gath**** boys to the momentary halt was not one of surprise.
"I don't think that's going to work on a Spi*** Level 5 from the start!　Not yet!　Bakuganfuda!
Do-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo!
The boys who had gathered all at once released a talismanic bomb that used condensed ****itual power. The power of the bomb ***ies greatly depend*** on the amount of ****itual power the user can han***, but the light at the moment the power ****odes can be used as a distraction. It is a ***hly versatile technique.
I wonder if this is the result of team ****ning. The response to emerge***** is much better than when the shikigami ran amok in early spring.
I'm ……sorry. Thank you.
I ***nked the boys as they dragged me near the school building.
"Heh. It's okay. You're my tribute to Misaki-chan.
I was ***pid enough to be grateful.
"All right, the secondhand store has been recove***!　Those of you with energy to spare, ***pare for the High Level Capt*** Technique!　Stall for time until bac*** arrives...
Doh! 　Gosh!
"What? What?
The voice of the man who was in command was drow*** out by the roar of the crowd.
A cloud of dust rose up aro*** the ***ored gia*** that had been ****loped in the light of the bombs and demon cards, repelling all of the ****wing talis****. Crack!　The armo*** giant took a step ***ward with*** regard to the ***ing dust and sand, and began to blast forward in a straight line. Not a scratch on its armor.
Don't ……stand in the way of the pedop****'s extinction!
What the hell is that? What the fuck?
In the event that you have any ****tions conce***** where and the best way to get in touch with your loved ones, please do not ****tate to cont*** us.
Oh, shit!　Get away from me!
Oh!　Hey, Furuya! Hey!
I pus*** a nearby boy out of the way and ran to the less popular side. Thanks to the first aid kit, I was able to ***over some movement, but it was impossible to escape. So, I had to run into the school building to buy some time.
I'm not sure what to do.
"Whoa! What?
The longsword ***nced just above my head - the entrance to the school building was ***cked with debris.
A clang. The sound of metal approa***** right behind me. I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm sure it's a good idea.
There are no ****sure pores in that huge body.
The exorcism that the boys were desper***** trying to ***eash had no effect. The wards were less than comforting.
I don't know how much longer I can hold out, but……...
He ****ified his ****nses with his extra-human hands to protect his battered body.
But the next moment. It wasn't me who was hit by a ****rful blow.
I'll be back! Aah!
Boom!　Go-o-o-o-o-o-o-o!
"What? What?
The armo*** giant blew up almost level with the ground and ***shed into the neighboring school building. Some classroom colla****, bury*** the armo*** giant in a pile of rub***.
What the hell? What's all the fuss? Why don't you at least let me take my make-up class quietly?
It was the pony-tailed *****lgirl who knocked away the giant West*** knight with a spectacular ***ping kick.
"Well, I guess I owe you a lit*** something.
It was Mutsumi Nagumo, a powe**** kendo girl who was once fea*** as a breast-avoiding woman in Shinonome City.
　　　　　5
「「「「 Oooohhh!　You're the best! 」」」」
It was the boys in D class who got excited at once.
The rest of the class ****owed suit, roll*** their eyes at Nagumo's ****ical abilities.
The armo*** giants that had defied the techniques of more than a dozen ***ple were defeated by bare hands. That's surp***ing.
"Nagumo!　You seriously saved my life, thank you.
No, not yet.
Nagumo turns his sharp gaze to the collapsed classroom.
Clang. The armo*** giant ***hes aside the rubble and sta*** up. ****ough part of his armor is cracked, he is holding a large longsword and is *****aching us with unhurried steps.
"Tsk. I guess it's impossible to use bare hands with this ***ght difference.
Nagumo ***ned his attention to the collapsed school building at the entrance and grabbed the ***osed steel frame. BOGO. The steel frame, over a meter long, was pulled out and Nagumo held it up to his eyes.
"Yes, it's a lit*** ***cker than a shinai. But that's about right.
I mean, he's a ***tle thick. Is ……he serious?
"DAAAAAAH!
I meant it!
Using the steel frame as a shinigami sword, Nagumo sliced ****first into the ***ored giant.
"Pedophile……. Must…… be punished.
"Oh?　You're not talking...
Nangumo's steel frame intersected with a longsword that was even ***ger than the steel frame.
"You'd better hone your skills before you talk like that!
The opposite of his rough tone. It's not that I don't like it, but it's not that I don't like it.
"D-oh-oh-oh!
One ***ave across the steel frame.
The armo*** giant, which had been hit by a ****rful blow to the leg, spun ***und and flew ***ough the air.
……Oh, man.
I didn't know I fought that guy when he was out of his mind ***ling me to let him rip my tits off. I'm still scared after all this time. I'm not going to be able to say no to him if he seriously asks me to remove his climax in the ***ure…….
I was stunned by Nagumo's sheer ****ting ability, but ……that didn't stop the ***ored giant from sinking. It ***ned its red eyes on me and stood up ***hout any discipline.
You're solid. Hey, Furuya!　I thought you said that mons**** could be defeated with bare hands!
Maybe he's too big to be a ***ster, so he's covering his body with a ……special ****itual ****tance.
If so, it's pretty nasty.
Although Nagumo's ****ical abilities are out of this world, it doesn't mean that he can use demonology. It would be difficult to do effec**** ***age to an armor comp**** of spiri**** substance.
That's what I'm talking about. ……But I guess we can at least hold them off until the teachers get here.
Boom!　Gush!　Crunch, crunch, crunch!
"Hahahaha!　It's been a while since I've felt like giving it my all in a match!
"Whoa.……
Metal clashed violently with metal, caus*** violent ****ical ***rks to fly. I was about to walk around behind the armored giant when the clash between Nagumo and the armored giant began to resemble a great monster war. I've got to look for a pleasu***** *****disiac for when the time comes.
What the hell is this!　Why is a 5th level monster here!　And it looks like that.……
And then I heard Sakura's voice behind us.
The att*** on Spirit Class 5 had cau*** quite a stir, and Sakura wasn't the only one who ***hed to the scene. Students of all classes and both genders were there. There were even a few teachers in the crowd. I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
With such a large number of peo*** in place, and with Nagumo controlling the armored giant itself, he was sure that the exorcism was comp****. This was when I was ****inced that the exorcism was complete.
"……Ah?　Huh?
Gulp!
Nagumo, who had been engaged in a vigorous ***tle with the armored giant, suddenly fell to his knees.
"Nagumo! 　What's wrong, are you okay? Are you okay?
"No, my ****ngth is suddenly gone…………. What?
A longsword attacked Nagumo, who had cre***d a large gap. He was easily blown away by the longsword, which he had been able to catch. He managed to catch Nagumo ***ing towards him with his humanized hands.
Hey, are you okay?　What's going on?
"No, that's it.……
Nagumo loo*** down at his hands curiously. Eventually, his gaze ***ned to Sakura, who was running towards him.
"My big tits are shak*** and I'm ***ing…… ……****ngth.
Did you hit your head? 　Are you okay? 　Hey!　Stay with me, Nagumo!
"No, I'm sure of it. Every time ……your sister gets closer, my body ***rts to…… ……relax.
As I said, Nagumo's whole body relaxed ****uidly in my arms.
It's hard to believe, but no matter ……how much I try, there's no way Nagumo would perform a one-shot gag about her poor ***asts under such circumstances. She's serious about this. I'm sure you'll agree. I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
So I screamed as hard as I could.
"Get back!　All you big tits get out of here!
What? 　What are you talking about? What are you talking about?
No!　C, ……no, all girls over A-cup, move out!　Especially Sakura!　You, right now!
I don't get it!
I don't get it either!
But since Nagumo said so, it can't be helped!
It's fortuitous for me that I know how to control Nagumo's monstrous power, but ……now is not the time!
"Pedophile. ……Kill…….
While we were arguing, an armored giant came running towards us. I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm sure it's a good idea.
I reconfirmed that the armored giant's murderous intent was only dire**** at me, and I started to run as far away from Nagumo as possible.
That's when it happened.
"You're in my way, Mr. Furuya.
A warm, fuzzy feeling ****loped me along with an ice cold voice.
It's the silvery-white beast tail that has hung me and Sakura up many times since we were children. The tail of a fox.
I didn't expect the monster to jump in from the other side.
***und my waist. Maple, with mult**** tails ***wing out of the space above her uniform, landed between me and the armored giant - and it was all too one-sided from there.
"Pedophile……. Pedophile…….
Go away.
Shoo...shoo...shoo!
The four white silvers caught the armored giant with ****ding speed and knocked it down. Before the armored giant could even get up, its limbs were coi*** up and it was thrown to the ground like a piece of trash.　It arced thro*** the air and was thrown to the ground like a piece of trash.
With*** pause, the ground around where the armored giant had fallen emitted a pale light.
"Necrotic seizure, self-destruct sequence.
He must have fini**** his prep work before ****wing the armored giant off.
The moment Kaede chanted some kind of scary incantation, the arms and legs of the armored giant were fixed to the ground with a gruesome sound. I'm sure…… you'll be able to figure out what's going on.
I'm not very good at dealing with monsters. ……It's hard to control the fire.
Go-o-o-o-o-o!
The ***fire was created by Kaede, who used her tail to jump to the side of the ward. The blue-white fla***, which also acted on the spirit, ***led the interior of the ward. The holes in the wards were for shoo**** fla*** into.
Blue flames fil*** the wards. The armored giant's figure is ****lowed by the flames and soon becomes invisible.
I'll be back. I'm sorry.
The ***ise of a steaming armored giant.
I was ***eady taken aback by Kaede's methods. I'm not sure…… what to make of this.
See, it's not only the students who have gathered here, but the teachers are a bit taken aback, too.
"Oh, um, Kuzunoha-senpai……?　Is the person inside okay?
"Don't worry. I'm sure he's not dead.
I'm sure you'll be pleased to know that I'm not the only one who's a bit of a jerk.
There was not even a bone left in the body.
Whoa, whoa! 　Maple ***ally killed someone... oh no! Aah!
"Shut up. And what do you mean, 'finally'?
Kaede slaps me to shut me up, but if that's the case, then why isn't there a person inside the ward who should have been the core of the monster? It's burning up with*** a trace.
"……That's odd. It doesn't smell like burned flesh to me.
How do you know the smell of burning human flesh?……
"Did he escape from the ……self-blocking formation?　Or is it some kind of remote-*****olled monster?……
Kaede, who had been pondering next to me, gradually tur*** serious.
"Either way, it's not a nor*** spirit level 5. I have to report to the association to raise the alert level.……
I'm not sure what's going on, but I guess the armored giant from earlier is still alive and well.
I took a breath and was about to go check on Nagumo when I ****ized…… that I had managed to eliminate the curr*** threat.
By the way, Mr. Furuya.
Maple's tail, which had just treated the armored giant like a piece of trash, wriggled as if to block my escape route. Oh, that?　Why am I being surrounded?……
It ***med to me that there was a pedop**** sla*** out to get you, can you explain what you mean?
Oh.
That's what it ***ked like to me, too. I didn't think you were the one avoiding Misaki Soya.……
Sakura ran up to me and grabbed my wrist and belt.
Um, can you stop grabbing me like you're trying to stop me from running away?
I opened my pouty lips to the murderous eyes of Kaede and the serious face of Sakura.
……I've been thinking. I think that armored giant might have been a different monster than the ****phile ***yer.
"Little girl. Get in touch with Misaki Soya.
"All right, vixen. I'll get you an interrogation site while I'm at it.
Aaahhhh!
　　　　　6
Testimony No. 1
"No, he was totally targeting Furuya. No matter how many times we all attacked him, he kept going straight for Furuya.
Testimony No. 2
The pedop**** sla*** has followed Furuya into the school building.
Testimony #3
I've known for a long time that he was crazy. I'm not sure what to make of it. I'm not sure what to make of a little girl who can't even produce breast milk.
"Well... The above information has pro*** that it is an objective fact that Haruhisa Furuya was targeted by the pedop**** sla***.
Sakura, who had finished playing back the mosai**** voice data, opened her mouth solemnly.
This is my room with the curtains closed.
Sakura and Kaede stood on either side of me with grim faces, and I, who was ****osed to be the master of the room, was tied to a chair. There was no escape. There was no hope. There would be no mercy for me.
The trial of Haruhisa Furuya, suspected pedop****, will now begin!
I shou*** at Sakura, knowing it was useless, as she annou**** the opening of a trial worse than a witch trial.
Stop it!　At least get me a defense attorney!　I don't care if it's Karasuma or Nagumo!
"How can a ****phile have a defense attorney!
I was alre*** a confirmed ****phile before the trial even started.
I'm not a pedop****!　I'm not a ****phile!
"Then what the hell is this!
Bang!
Sakura slammed my phone and computer on the desk.
For a moment, I was nervous, but there was a password set on it. I was thinking that even if I was ***tured, I wouldn't enter the password, but……!
"Hmmm. Combi**** birthdays and favorite foods has always been short sighted.
I guess my little stalker streak came in handy.
"Who's your stalker?　That's not the point right now!
Sakura bit Kaede, then took control of her phone and computer - and pointed at a screen full of secondary lolita ***ges.
How are you going to get away with collecting all this stuff? What are you going to say?
……No!
"Not only do you down**** images, but you also download questionable apps and even pay for ……this fucking creepy game called 'Pedophile GO'!
As my *****ction of living shame and *****rsions was unearthed one after ***ther, my whole body broke out in a strange sweat.
No, it's not!　It was saved ***hout my knowledge.……
"Huh?　You don't even know it's happening.
Sakura's eyes like look*** at a pig cove*** in filth.
You're up!　Misaki Soya!
"Yes!
Sakura signaled, and Soya's chee**** voice ***oed in the room.
It was from Kaede's phone, who apparently stubbornly refused to meet Soya.
Soya was staring at me thro*** his phone in video phone mode. The curse of hell, the lecher's eye, which bri*** up all kinds of sexual information.
"Yes!　You're looking at a lot of loli images!　I've been looking at a lot of lolita pict****! I'm a complete ****phile!
Strangely enough.
Soya had a big smile on his face. He was in a super good mood and certified me as a pedop****.
"Furuya-kun, you avoided me because you were embarrassed to be a pedop****. Oh, so that's what happened.
That's not true.……
What's with that reaction? You're smiling ……so much.
What was it that I was so *****rately trying to avoid Soya……?
The Soya guy is really nice to *****hiles. He's an angel.
When I was confused by Soya's reaction, Sakura was looking much more confused than I was, and she was looking at Soya's phone.
Hey! 　You don't care if he's a pedop****? 　What's with the carefree reaction?
"What?　Well, I think it's a little dangerous, but as long as you don't actually touch me, it's not a crime, and I have no problem working with you as a teammate.
"Oh, what?　Are you sure you only see Haruhisa Furuya as a teammate?
I'm not sure what to make of it, but I think it's a good idea.
I'll be next.
Kaede, who had put her phone in the breast pocket of her uniform, came up to me.
I'd say ……twelve for starters.
"What? What?
Kaede's figure dist**** like a mirage.
What appeared was a girl who ***ked like a youn*** ***sion of the ****nsely beautiful Kaede. Her eyes are sharp and she has the atmosphere of Kaede hers***, but she looks compl***** like an elementary school student.
I don……'t believe this guy.
"Hmm. Twelve is too old. How about ten next time?
Kaede's figure distorts again, revealing an even younger vers*** of her.
I knew it!
Kaede, are you going to use your shapeshifting skills to check how old I am?
I'm not kidding. The collection of loli images and Soya's psyc*** vision were both "mistakes! But if you see Kaede *****for*** into a little girl, you will not be able to get away with it. I'm not sure what to say, but my body is reacting.　My eyes are ***ling me more than I can say.　I'd recognize that guy as a pedop****.
I would never react to Kaede as a little girl!
With a firm resolve, I fixed my gaze on the cherry blossoms that had grown in abundance…….
"Looks like your strike zone is nine, Mr. Furuya.
I'm sorry…….
I…… couldn't look away.
My ****onal mind is ***ling me to stare at the cherry blossoms. I'm not even excited about Kaede's infant form, but my eyes are drawn to her. Seriously, what's going on here……?
While I was devastated, Kaede looked at Sakura for a moment and then looked at me.
"Well, maybe next time I'll make my ***asts bigger.
While still in her nine-year-old form, only her brea*** gradually grew larger...
I see. Furuya-kun likes nine-year-olds with A-cups or smaller. He's a complete ****phile.
After concl***** this, Kaede transforms into a vine little girl and looks up at me with cold eyes.
"Hey, Mr. Furuya. Aren't you ***amed of yourself?　You're a pedop****, after all.　It's disgusting. The only partner who can lega*** sati*** the desires of a pervert like you is a direct descendant of Kuzunoha, who can use transformation techniques. Well, there's no way there's ***one like that in my family. If that's the case, what will happen to you in the future when you can only see elementary school students as your love interest?
Kaede ***les lecherously at me in her little girl form and places her small, pudgy hand on my cheek. When I can't argue with Kaede's ver*** abuse…….
"Hey, vixen!　Don't you dare provoke the ****phile!
Sakura forcibly pulled Lori Kaede away.
"I knew it!　Pedophiles are the worst!　Furuya-kun, you're super creepy! 　Hurry up and fix it!　Cure me of *****hilia!
Soya was snapping at the other side of the screen.
I'm not ……sure what to make of…… it, but I'm ……sure it's a good idea.
Come on!　I told you so! 　If Furuya Haruhisa is a ****phile, that woman will be the sole winner!
'Yes, I know exactly what you mean!　I felt very annoyed and disgusted. That's why pedop***** are so hated in the world!　There must be a ****phile sla*** born!
"……Hmm?　I…… think we're getting off on the wrong foot here.　Maybe you're not…… aware.
Once again, Sakura was sneaking around with Soya through her phone, and Kaede let out a big sigh, "Well, so much for jokes.
Soya's daughter is right, we need to deal with your sexuality as soon as possible.
Yura. Kaede's surrou****** become hazy, and her figure ***urns to that of a seventeen-year-old.
"Even with the ****phile sla*** incident, the association has become hypersensitive in many ways. How much trouble would…… it be if the owner of such an ability turned out to be a pedop****?
"……Indeed. I've been attacked by a ****phile sla*** in such a spectacular manner that the Audit Department will hear about it ***hout my having to report it. I wouldn't be surprised if they start talking about replacing me with a much ****cter watchdog than me.……
Sakura ***ees with Kaede's words with a serious expression.
I have to cure ……this perverted ****phile at all costs!　It is the job of the watcher to prevent the target from doing something before it happens!
Sakura said in a ****what excuse-like tone and turned to Kaede.
What's going on? What's going on ***hout me……?
"So?　How are we going to correct this guy's *****hilia?
"Let's torture him.
Um, Kaede?　Excuse me?　You can't torture the daughter of a fam*** family. Right?
"Show her Lori and give her pain at the same time, and show her a ***mal woman and give her candy at the same time. Let's repeat this for a start.
Maple, with a straight face, lights a foxfire on her fingertips.
"Mr. Furuya, we're going to make you human again.
　　　　　7
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!　Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
I had compl***** lost my composure after the attack on the ****phile sla*** and the pedop**** trial, but I finally realized something. If I just let things go on like this, I would be killed. That cold look in Kaede's eyes. She had a dangerous look in her eyes, as if she would take out her balls to correct a pedop****.
***ven by such fear, I despe****ly plead my case.
Just before I was attacked by the ****phile sla***, I heard the word "curse" from Sakura, which made me realize the possibility. This is about the reason why I suddenly became a ****phile.
"Listen to me!　I've gone crazy since I touched that little girl!
It was a hypothesis that I ****ered about myself.
But this sudden and inexplicable pedophilia. I couldn't think of any other reason.
"The day before yesterday in Harugahara, I met a strange girl!　She was wearing a red dress and asked me if I was a ****phile. And when I touched her, I felt a strange sensation in my head and groin...
When I said that much, I ***iced that Sakura and Kaede were alre*** looking at me with a look of dismay.
I mean, who are you?
I wonder if it was the contact with the little girl that turned him on to Lolita.
No, no, no!　I'll admit my expression was a little weird, but that's not what I meant!
He tells her ***wly, after catching his breath.
I think she has some kind of curse, or else she's a monster. "I think she has some kind of curse, or else she's a monster that turns peo*** into *****hiles or something like that. So, if you can see me, your suspi**** that I'm a ****phile should be cleared up.
"……
Hey!　Don't ***pare to torture me ***hout saying a word!　No, stop it!　Stop boar**** up the ***dows and doors so no one can hear you, and listen to me!
My two childhood friends are so smooth in their torture preparation that I'm about to leak.
"Sakura!　See, you told me! 　You said you'd help me if I was cursed!　Now's the time!
"What?　Die, pedop****.
There is no…… mercy.
"That's ……true. There's something wrong with it, if you ask me.
"Yes, Soya.
While the two ****ible childhood friends were sile**** ****aring for the torture, the voice of salvation arrived from the phone on the desk.
I saw your face every day, but I never saw any sign of pedophilia.……
The Soya on the screen twists his head as he stares at me with eyes that have a heart mark in them.
I'm not…… even using the images I've colle****. I'm not using any of the images I've collected, but I'm looking right at the little girl, and…… my conscio****** and my actions are all over the place. It may be that it is because of the monster.
Kaede and Sakura looked at each other when they heard Soya, who had seen the sexual information of various ***ple, say this.
"See? 　I knew there was something wrong with me, my pedophilia!
There wasn't anything wrong with my head or my bottom half!
This made me feel more and more like a fool for avoiding Soya, but that didn't matter anymore.
"……I don't blame you. It's a silly hypothesis, but if there's ***ther monster that can turn peo*** into pedop***** apart from the pedophile ***yer, there's no ***ling ……how far the dam*** will spread.
Kaede reluct***** approaches me from an angle that doesn't show up on my phone. She puts her hand on my head and closes her eyes.
I felt relieved that my suspicion of pedophilia had finally been resolved.
I don't see anything …………unusual.
What?
"It's perfectly ***mal. There's no evidence of any strange influence or curse at all.
What? 　No, that can't be right! 　False positive, false positive!
"You're the lowest ***rer of all time and you're questioning my psyc*** vision?
Oh, my ***des have nothing to do with it!　I mean...
"That's because I don't have direct contact with it like I do with my regu*** checkups, so it's not as ****rate. "That's right.
Shut up.
What? Why? 　The doctor said…… it would be more accurate if I touched her ***ing my regular checkup.
It's just that it's a special psyc*** vision for regular checkups and it's better to touch it directly, but it has nothing to do with the ***mal ***chic vision in this place, so don't mention it furt*** or I'll burn you to death.
Kaede says in one breath in my ear. I ***ded meekly, too swiftly.
If you don't trust the vixen's psyc*** vision, I'll give you a second opinion.
Sakura put her hand on my head with a confident look on her face. Kaede grabbed her hand.
"What?　What are you, a vixen?
No, I'm just ****ering what kind of techniques the peo*** in Audit use to see things.
"What?　You can only find such a thing in the general-purpose Kou style for *****osing psychic distur*****s, or the soul reson**** style for checking for monstrosity.
"Right. That's fine. I just thought that stalkers have no idea what kind of psychic visi*** they're capable of in the heat of the moment, so don't worry about it.
That's why!　Don't treat me like a stalker, bitch!
After a *****rious ****ange, Sakura gave me a psychic ***ding with a serious look on her face. However.
"……Yeah, there's nothing wrong with that. Your pedophilia is *****etely natural.
Sakura announced the diagnosis with a look of complete filth in her eyes.
That's ridiculous…….
If that's the case, does that mean I'm a pedophile……?　No,…… that's not…… possible.
"……Hmm?
Leaving me in despair and Soya still tilt*** his head, the preparations for torture in the name of pedophile *****ction resumed.
"Here, how's this? Here.
I'm sorry…….
Sakura, who was now red up to her neck, came at me with two buttons of her shirt open.
The two ric*** fruited fruits formed a magnificent cleavage and were ***ust at my nose. As the girl's scent ***fted thickly into the air, I said to Sakura with a straight face.
I think it's wrong for a girl to do that, big brother.
"Don't treat me like a child!　Also, that straight face is annoying!
Sakura shoved a sugar cube into my mouth. It was vomit-sweet.
Then I'll be next.
It was Kaede, now in her nine-year-old form, who *****ached me.
Even though she didn't come at me with her clothes off like Sakura did, my eyes were drawn to her and I felt a ……slap!　Kaede's full force slap landed on my cheek. I'm tied to a chair, so I can't let the ***act escape, and it hits me in the core of my head.
"……Hmm, I don't see any change.
Then Soya ****rves me through his phone and ***cks to see if the pedophile is easing up.
The *****etely *****ective pedophile correction went on and on, and it was alre*** evening.
Soya looked at my ***llen cheek and let out a skeptical voice.
I think I'm going to develop anot*** sexuality before my pedophilia is cured. Like masochism.
Pedophiles and masochists……. That's the worst kind of complication.
Lori Kaede ***ters with an exhau**** expression. I'm the one who's fall*** apart both phys****ly and mentally…….
I mean, I don't get it!
Sakura barked as she ***ered her chest.
It's not fair! 　It's not fair!　We should take turns!　It might even work!
"What are you talking about?　You grew up in vain. How can you play the role of a loli?　You'll just have to let Mr. Furuya keep staring at you with a straight face.
I don't want to be the only one with a straight face all the time!　Anyway, I don't want to be the only one with a straight face all the time!
"Rejected. I don't have time to waste on useless things. It's the right place at the right time.
"Uhhhh!
Kaede ***erts with*** listening to the teary-eyed Sakura's arguments. No mercy.
"……I'll wear a bathing suit, ……no under****.……
Hey, Sakura?　Your eyes are kind of fixed, are you okay?
I wondered if there would be any pressure or responsibility as a watchdog.
Beep beep.
There was an inco**** call on the phone with Soya's image on it. Kaede took it, and right after she made a few chirps. She was ****usted, and her expression became even more grim.
As ……you can see, we're getting nowhere if we spend any more time *****cting pedop*****.
What the hell was that call about?
I'm going to change my ways. You do the rest, little girl.
Kaede reverted to her seventeen year old form and left my room, ripp*** off the door liner.
"No, I asked you.…… What's with that woman?
Sakura murmured quizzically, but there was no one to answer her.
After that.
The pedophile correction was continued by Soya and Sakura, who had ***ned the group after Kaede disappeared.
"Hey, Sakura-chan! 　What are you doing trying to take off your uniform? What are you doing?
It's because you never change your role as a loli! 　I can't take it anymore!　Even if this guy is a true pedophile, he'll react a little!
No, no, no!　I'll never allow that!
"Then get rid of that annoying two-headed god and give me the loli role!
As Kuzunoha-san said, the right person for the right job.　Sakura-chan just needs to keep giving Furuya-kun a straight face, okay?
You fucking bitch…….
Oh, no!　Sakura-chan is a pervert!　Furuya-kun, don't look!
However, with Kaede, the calm commander, gone, the situation became chaotic in less than an hour, and Soya's shikigami was stuck to my face without any results.
I'm not sure what I did to deserve this, but I've been thinking about it ever since I ***cued ……that little girl in the red dress…….
"……What?　A call at this hour?
After Kaede, Sakura's phone also ****ived an inco**** call.
Sakura, who ***med to have gotten dres*** again, interrupted her altercation with Soya and headed for the door.
"……Hey, Mr. Furuya.
Soya spoke to me with some conc*** for Sakura. There were four two-headed gods ****ting around me, making my gaze wander. I'm sure I'm not a pedophile, but……...
I'm not sure what to make of…… it. I'm not sure what to make of it. And if you think about it, the sudden increase in pedop***** in Harugahara...
What? What?
Soya's words were interrupted mid-****ence by Sakura's voice, full of astonishment.
No, no, wait a minute. It's a mistake, isn't it?　I'm sure you're not…… the only one who has a problem with this.
I could tell that this was something that the Audit Department was not ****osed to ***ulge to us. But Sakura didn't have time to worry about that, she was shou**** into the phone.
"A mistake on the paperwork, a mix-up with ***ther case... oh my God!　I can't talk to you if you're my liaison!
Sakura wildly exploded in frustr***** and hung up the phone.
However, despite her *****ssive mood - Sakura's complexion is pale.
"Sakura-chan?　Uh, what was that call about, I wonder?
Even Soya, who had been ****ting with Sakura just a moment ago, called out to him as if he cared.
I'm sorry…….
For a while, Sakura seemed to be unsure ***ther she should tell us about it or not, but then her lips quiv**** and she let out a dry voice.
I now know why ……that vixen left to change her ways. I think she was ****rmed of this information by someone from Kuzunoha who works in the auditing department.
Sakura let out a rage of being compl***** unconvinced and spoke the rest of the story.
"There's going to be an execu**** sess*** of the Audit Department. I want you as a defendant.
"What?　You don……'t mean that.
Audit Department ****utive Committee. Commonly known as the decapi****** trial.
It was the name of an intra-association trial that was supp**** to be held only to hand down a specific sentence to a convi**** special psychic criminal.
Chapter 4: There is No Tomorrow for Pedophiles
　　　　　1
There's no way I'm going to be decapitated for a crime I didn't commit. There's ……****nitely been a mistake…….
A confused looking Sakura was restl***** calling the person who seemed to be the head and master of the auditing department. But he couldn't seem to get through. She continued to operate the term**** as if in a hurry.
 ……But well, maybe the conclusion that the auditing department came to me was also a natural one.
As Mei also warned me, the Retribution Association is now facing very strong public ****tiny due to the pres**** of insiders and pedophile sla***s who leak information to the media.
In the midst of all this, "A pedophile with the obscene ability to expel ****axes is doing the expulsion work! "We have alre*** made a live girl climax! We have already made a live girl climax!" If such a thing were known, the association would be finished.
I understand the desire to dispose of a perverted degenerate like me in secret.
Now that Kaede and Sakura have also diagn**** him as a pedophile, the only thing he can do is sit back and accept his punis***** as a perverted clima**** man who only cau*** anxiety in the world...
I can't accept that!　What's with the decapi****** trial all of a sudden!
If I'm gui*** from the start, there's no reason for me to stay quiet. I'll take my chances and go look for the monster that made me a pedophile! I'm going to go find the monster that made me a pedophile!
Sakura didn't seem convinced, and I was thinking about how I could get her to let me go... while she was tied to the chair.
Tëm!
What the hell? 　What is this, a ****ical boun****? What is this?
What? 　You didn't even check with me at the scene, it's too…… soon.
Soya and Sakura looked out the window and shouted. When they turned around, they saw that a thick, *****lucent wall had indeed appeared there. It was the same technique that Sakura had used before to lock the boys in the school building.
"As expected of Inspector Buncho Sakura. In such a short time since the call came in, you've already deta**** the target of your surveillance.
I put a ****ical ward on it just in case, but it wasn't necessary, was it?
And then two men suddenly barged into the room.
The black suit, the flawless gait - he was from the Audit Department.
He must have been on standby, ready to move at the same time as the call to Sakura.
"Mr. Haruhisa Furuya. You've been ***ered to appear before the Audit Department's Executive Committee. Would you please accompany me?
It's over……. In an instant, the devious plan to take a chance and go looking for the monster was foiled……. I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm sure it's a good idea.
Wait a minute!
That's when it happened. Sakura stood in front of the two ****tors who were relent****** clos*** in on her.
"What?　Inspector Buncho Sakura?
You don't think it's funny, do you? 　No matter how much of a pervert this guy is, he can't just suddenly go to the execu**** board!
I know it's strange, but orders from above... Hmm?
The two ****tors froze in mid-sentence.
Misaki Soya? Soya Misaki!
They ran out the front door, push*** each other to the side.
"Inspector Bunbori Sakura! 　Why are you in the same room with the Soya family's daughter and not a care in the world? What?
You're the one who made me feel safe in my room!
He started to protest something to Sakura. The inspe**** was a…… human being.
"You don't have to run away so fast.……
And Soya was alone and depressed again. I really pity her. Whore's eyes.
I have nothing to be ***amed of.
Sakura chased after the two ***itors as they ran out the door.
"Are you even human if you don't have anything to be ashamed of? 　No, I don't care about that right now. If you don't mind meeting the daughter of the Soya family, take her out of the ward right now. After that, we will esc*** Haruhisa Furuya to the association ******arters.
I can't accept this until I hear directly from my master or even the director! There's talk of an informant, and I won't be convinced until I hear directly from my master, or even the director!
Sakura ****inues to bite the two audi**** at a furious pace.
You're covering for me, aren't you?
The same thing happened when she said, "I can lift the curse for you," which was a stark contrast to her usual stern ****tude. When I was taken aback by Sakura's words and actions.
While you still can.
"What? 　Soya? Soya!
Soya jum*** at the knot in the rope tying me up.
I can't help but feel that Mr. Furuya is beco**** a pedophile. Kuzunoha's psychic vision didn't reveal anything, but…… I believe in him.　If he's going to be found guilty anyway, let's run away and look for the pedophile monster before that happens!
Apparently, Soya was thinking the same thing as I was.
I'd really *****ciate it…….
Don't do it!　If you help me escape with two other audi**** besides Sakura, you'll be in trouble! "No!
I'm going to ask my parents to do everything they can to protect me.
Soya sniffs ***fledly.
Unlike Kaede, she doesn't have the same dignity, so it's easy to for*** that she's also the heiress of a famous ****itual family. I'm sure you'll be able to understand why.
Just because you're covering for me doesn't mean you're compl***** innocent.
"You told me, didn't you, Mr. Furuya?
Soya interrupted my words as he unt*** the rope.
"It's my fault that peo*** around me found out about my ability to expel ****axes, so I have to take responsibility and stay with you until the bottom of hell.
A few days after the defeat of the milk-avoiding woman, I said to Soya, "Team disbanded? I said to a half-hearted Soya.
We're not at the bottom of hell yet, so it's only natural to help.
I'm sorry…….
"And you also said that you would stay with me forever. He also said that he would always be there for me. That's why I won't allow myself to drop out at this place. I want to lift the curse together with you, Furuya-kun.
Soya, who had untied the ropes, said it straight to the point.
……Sorry. Thanks.
It's okay, it's okay, we're ****mates!
So?　What do we do now?　If you're going to help me, then you must have a plan, right?
This room is ****ently completely ***ered by a powerful ****ical ward. Soya's jutsu is not very powerful, but he has a wide range of jutsu that he can use, so maybe he has some jutsu that I don't know about.
"……Let's see, while I'm distra***** the audi*** with my shikigami, Mr. Furuya's climax-removal rituals are stab**** the auditor.
You're an asshole!
What are you gonna do, pile on the sins?
In fact, before that, it's too much of a hurdle for two people who seem to be as good as or better than Sakura to be able to ****cise a climax head-on. And even if it did work, Sakura would prob**** kill me.
But there's no other way to break through this powerful phys**** barrier, and we're ……stuck!
Oh!　They're untying the rope.
No!　If you let him go, the director will kill you!　Socially!
Even the auditors noticed.
Perhaps it's because I have a high level of trust in phys**** wards and fear of lecherous eyes that I don't immediately try to seize you, but…… this makes surprise attacks impossible.
Damn, I guess I'll just have to be a grown-up and get convicted, huh?
Mr. Furuya.
"What? What?
We need to sharpen our minds once again.
It was the first time I heard the voice clearly since the day I got rid of the milk-avoiding woman.
You have one chance. I will release the power of climax expulsion.
"……No, no, no, no.
I took off the bracelets on my hands before I could be surprised by the voice I hadn't heard in a long time.
Soya said, "Let's give the auditor a poke! But it's not.
I had turned my back on the auditors. It's not that I don't like it, it's just that I don't like it.
What the hell is he doing? 　Don't worry about the evil eye!　Restrain him!
The auditor pus*** past the cherry blossoms and steps into the room.
But my fingertips had already poked the plea**** apholes of the wards.
Instantly, the entire room, which had been ****loped in warding, ***ted into a fetal ****tion.
Vivisection!
The entire room - no, the phys**** ward - was at its peak.
This is... the seis*** capability you repo****? 　Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Gogo gogo gogo!
A slight tremor, a shak*** that seemed to come from below, and violent convulsions.
Various trem*** randomly hit the entire room, making it impossible to stand ****erly.
"Not just inorg****s, but even wards.……
The shaking subsided, and I was wonde**** what kind of ability I had.
"Hmm? Hmm?
Soya shouted.
"The physical boundaries are loose and tight! 　Even…… my kids can do this!
Stop!　You can't force a physical boundary like that...
The auditor's cry did not reach him. The moment Soya's shikigami broke through the physical boundary along with the cracked window....　A tremendous impact occurred.
「「「「 ohhh! 」」」」
In the event that you have any questions regar**** where and the best way to get in touch with us, please do not ****tate to contact us.
The moment I thought, "Oh, I'm dead," to the floa**** sensation that occurred in pursuit
"Oh, look out!
Soya's shikigami caught me and Soya, and we landed on the ground in a heav*** motion.
……You're being reckless.
Not as good as what you can do, Mr. Furuya.　What kind of ****ciple would allow you to turn a physical boundary into something like that? What princ****?
……I don't understand it either.
After escaping from the inspe****, we headed for Harugahara at a glance, under the cover of darkness.
 ……But still.
That voice that I heard again. And the inorg**** climax that became available at the perfect time.
Kaede had given me a lot of advice, but it still seemed like she was just trying to help us.
　　　　　2
This is where you said the weird girl was, right?
Yeah. Black hair in a red dress. She's got a face like a doll.
Harugahara just before sunset.
Soya and I looked around the crowd, looking for the little girl who seemed to have turned me into a pedophile.
It was unlikely that the little girl would be wandering around the same place at this time of night, much less in the same clothes, but even so, there were no other clues at the moment.
I wandered around for a while through the crowded stre*** with poor visib*****, ***ping an eye out for the Audit Department's pursuers, but as expected, I couldn't find them conveniently. Occasionally, my gaze is drawn to a father and son.
If only we had a little more manpower. But I don't know how widespread the story is that Soya and I esca*** from the Audit Department…….
"Hmm?　Isn't that a second-hand shop for Miss Misaki? Wasn't today's patrol in Harugahara canceled?
"Karasuma! "Karasuma!
With a bang.
It was Karasuma in a pants suit that I ran into on the main street of Harugahara.
What the hell are you doing here?
That's my line, though. If you were to ask me what I was doing, I would say that I was bored and looking for my destiny. ***ing my patrol, I noticed that there were quite a few beautiful women in this town.
You're picking on me.
But I don't care about Karasuma's private life, this is a great opportunity for me.
"Karasuma. I'm sorry to do this out of the blue, but I was ****ering if you could come with us to find the little girl.
"What?　A little girl?
I know you're wondering what I'm talking about. But let me explain the situation. We are...
I was about to continue, "I'm looking for a monster that turns people into pedop*****," but my words were cut off mid-sentence.
"Excellent!　I'll find you the best little girl you can find, no need to ask!
"……Huh?　Karasuma?
I was surprised to see Karasuma's unusual enthusiasm for ***ding young girls, and Soya's eyes wide***.
"Oh, what?　Aoi-chan is having a fantasy of tying up a ……little girl……?
As if to prove Soya's words, Karasuma rambles on in a state of excitement.
You can't go wrong with a little girl. Her body is ……immature and her limbs are soft. I can climax just by imagining the rough rope digging into that soft skin that a mature adult woman can never have. It……'s…… a great way to make sure that you don't end up in a situation where you can't ……get out of it.
As soon as he thought he had uttered some kind of indefensible nonsense, Karasuma suddenly started running!
"If Furuya wants us to go get the little girl, we have no choice!　Isn't this unavoidable! I don't have a choice.
He shouted something like, "What's wrong? Oh no!
"Aoi-chan is turning into a complete pedophile! "Aoi has become a complete pedophile!
I'll kill you to stop you!
A domi**** pedophile is more dangerous than a pedophile with climax expulsion!　It's a quarantined species.
It's nice to meet you, little girl. I'm going to give you some of my honey ***ered candy, so come with me. Come with me.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!　She's a little crazy!　He has seiz**** sometimes!
I'll make sure you're connected.　Excuse me!
Soya and I asse****d Karasuma and bowed as best we could to the father and son who rolled their eyes at us.
Why? 　You're the one who told me to go get the little girl, aren't you?
I said, "Find me!
I b***ked Karasuma's mouth and dragged him into a ****rted alleyway.
Then he finally let go of Karasuma's mouth.
Hey, Karasuma!　Did you happen to see a girl in a red dress? Have you seen a girl in a red dress?
You know……, I just helped a guy up who fell in front of me.
"...……and...
Soya and I looked at each other.
I knew I was right. There is definitely something that makes people become *****hiles.
But I don't know why. But I don't know why. Aoi-chan seems to be a pedophile to the core of her being, and her condi**** is quite different from Furuya-kun's.……
"Maybe because Karasuma is a pervert to the bone, he was a good match for the pedophile curse?
Well, that's not what I want to talk about right now.
"Hey Karasuma, where are you? 　Where'd you meet the girl? Where did you meet the girl?
It was only a short while ago that Karasuma met the girl. Then she must still be nearby.
"If I ……tell you, will you let me tie up the little girl?
Soya, do it.
Roger that!
Soya shoved his ever-present ear buds into Karasuma's ears.
"Oh my God! 　"I'm going to talk, I'm going to talk, I'm going to talk, so don't rub it in there! Aah!
Karasuma, who was weak to blame, burst into tears and vomited out the information.
Accor**** to the report, the girl in the red dress was found near a convenience store a short walk from here.
The four shikigami ***zed Karasuma, who turned into a domi**** pedophile monster, and Soya said.
I'll take Aoi-chan into custody, so you go ahead, Furuya-kun!　Before the little girl gets too far away!
Oh, okay!
It's somew**** around here.
I look around the area that Karasuma told me about.
A red dress would have been quite noticeable, but…… the sun was sett*** and it might be tough.
Still, I was desper***** searching the area.
"……Oh, no.
In the crowd, I saw a small red shadow.
I run as if impelled. The closer I get, the more certain I become.
Those conspi***** clothes. The oddity of walking around at this time of day with no one who looked like a guardian. No doubt about it.
Hey, kiddo. Hold on.
At that moment, I touched the girl's shoulder with my Demon Academy student ID card in my hand.
I'll be back.
The little girl's pudgy hand grabbed my wrist as if she had been waiting for me. ……What?
I finally found you, you pedophile.
The little girl looked back at me.
"If I hadn'……t been the one who first discovered you running from the auditors, you would have been ****osed of on the spot.
He glared up at me, his voice a terr**** mixture of anger and murderous intent.
"Kaede……?
Right after I realized who the little girl was.
Could it be the inspector who had been hiding around Kaede?
A figure in a black suit seized me, and my conscio****** was abru**** cut off there.
　　　　　3
"……? Huh?
It was not so much ***ing up as it was being forced to wake up.
I was…… not in a daze, and I quickly realized my ******ndings and my situation.
An inorganic hallway. I was in a state of complete bondage, ***ble to move anything except my eyes and mouth. In spite of this, the scen*** in my field of vision was slowly drifting backwards, and I knew that I was being transported somew**** on my own by some kind of telekinesis. The *****nation was most likely the venue for the decapitation trial, so this must be the basement of the association's ******arters. In the event that you have any kind of questions regarding where and how to use the internet, you can call us at the web site.
Hey Maple!　Listen, the monster that turns people into pedop***** is really... Ggh!
Don't talk nonsense.
Suddenly, the pressure around my throat intensified and my voice choked. It was the work of the auditor who had put a metal shac*** on my body.
Don't get upset. The people in the audit department are unforgiving, unlike me.
Kaede was quietly chiding me. If he was more merciless than Kaede, he would have been stran**** to death, but he merely lost his voice.
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to speak up now, ……but I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to speak up now.
We've almost confirmed the ****tence of a monster that turns people into *****hiles!
If I don't, I'll be condemned as a pedophile, and the pedophile ***yer will attack everyone who isn't a pedophile!
Also, if a guy like Karasuma becomes a pedophile, that's just bad!
I was just thinking about how I…… had to convince Kaede and the people in the auditing department to deal with this.
"Don't worry, I've asked Kuzunoha's people to send a survey team to Harugahara.
Kaede said something I didn't expect.
Huh?　Didn't you just judge me to be a pedophile?
It's enough to make an auditor run away. I'm sure your story about a monster that turns people into *****hiles isn't just a cop-out. It's just…….
"……?
Let's say you find a little girl who turns people into pedophiles. It doesn't mean that the Audit Department will relax their harsh atti**** towards you. Be ****ared for that.
What?　What…… does that mean?
I'm sorry. It's my fault that this happened.
……What? What?
Kaede apologized!
And I have no idea what Kaede is responsible for. I'm scared.
What is it?　Is it possible that I'm about to go through something worse than death?……
As I was ****bling with fear, a huge door appeared in front of me and opened without a sound.
"……Oh, no.
An overbe***** rush of spiritual power. I'm not sure what to make of this.
Many people from the "Nine Old Families" belong to the Audit Department. The Audit Department's executive committee, where some of the most powerful people in the department gather, is dominated by an unusually heavy and cold atmosphere.
The three ***dred and sixty images you have seen above were mainly collected from a ***site called "Beautiful Young Women Club". This is a game that uses location-based services, and the ****ents are so vile that we can only imagine that it is ****gned to train criminals to collect little girls on the street for swe*** and pocket money. From these data, it can be ****rred that the defendant's preferred type is a nine-year-old, dark-haired, ****rful and straight******* type, and there is no doubt that he is a pedophile.
 ……I'll be…… back…….
I was standing in the middle of a space that reminded me of a large court****, and my heart was breaking.
After I ran away, it seems that the computer and phone in my room were confiscated, and the contents have been completely analyzed.
It was a slender, middle-aged man who was pushing me to the depths of hell with his unhurried ******tation of these data. He looked like a picture of seriousness, with his suit, glasses, and head of hair fixed with hair conditioner.
In this court****, a courtroom without a judge, he was the main focus of the trial.
Kaede, who was standing beside me, explained to me that he was the pocket knife of the head of the auditing department. He is from one of the old families, the "Oni no Tara-ba", and is a very capable person.
This is the story of my pedophile ***tory as told to me by Tara.
No matter how much I chanted in my mind that it was not my intention to collect them, but the result of being pedophileized by that little girl, I couldn't stop sweating.
When Tara Bashi discl**** her browsing ***tory, her armp*** start to sweat!　When he discl**** his search history, his crotch starts to sweat!　My whole body is covered in sweat and I'm on the verge of dehydration. It's more painful than dying.……
The walls of the courtroom had a number of ****ties that could fit one person, and on the other side of the curtain, the auditors from the old family were staring at us. Because of the curtain, I can't see them from here, but I can tell that they're looking at me like I'm a sex offender. They're looking at me like I'm a sex offender.
In addition, he has the power to expel a spirit-level 6 monster with a ***gle blow, as reported earlier, and this ability is accompanied by the sexual climax of the target, which is unbelievable. Furthermore, there are many testimonies that a pedophile ***yer who appeared at the Demon Academy this afternoon was chas*** him. I can assure you that the information we have so far is correct, Inspector Buncho Sakura.
"……Yes.
The one who replied in a small voice was Sakura, who had been lying on the ground in frustration since the beginning of the trial. In the event that…… you have any questions ***cerning where and how to use the internet, you ……can contact us at our own web site.
After he finished disclosing all the information, Toraji looked around the entire courtroom.
In light of the above, there is no doubt that the accused is a pedophile with an uncommon ****city for indece***. The Audit Department believes that he should be locked up under a tight seal, permanently.
How hard can you be on a pedophile?
I heard about the guilty verdict, but I didn't hear about the life sentence!
All those in favor, raise your hands.
The people behind the curtain are raising their hands at an *****dible rate!
……No!
Seeing this, Sakura stood up with tremendous energy. But before Sakura could raise her voice, a quiet voice ech*** in the chamber.
Before we take a vote, my grandmother has a message for you.
It was Kaede, who was standing still beside me.
Who's the ……chairman?
He wants us to use Haruhisa Furuya as bait to make sure we kill the *****rious pedophile ***yer.
Does this mean that Kuzunoha will protect him?
I'm saying it's worth using.
Tara Blade and Kaede stared each other straight in the eye.
The Pedophile Slayer has the ability to move at a moment's notice. This is not only used to attack pedophiles, but also to escape from demons. This means that the pedophile ***yer must be able to use the pedophile as bait and still be able to kill him with a ***gle blow, and I can think of no one better to do this than Haruhisa Furuya.
Kaede tre*** me like a true pedophile in her words. Well, I was once targeted by a pedophile ***yer, so I can't deny anything.
If you plan your operation around him, you will need a minimum number of men. It is also possible to eliminate the pedophile sla*** secretly, without the public's attention being drawn to him. It would be a loss to the entire association to send such a ****nted person to jail.
I'll admit he's useful. I'll admit that he's useful, after all, he's the one who got rid of a spirit level 6 with a sin*** blow. But because of that, it seems like a tremendous risk to leave him out in the open.
Tara Blade's tone changes to a stern one.
Then he prese**** me again with a computer and phone full of secondary loli images. Stop it!
According to the data exchanged, his collection of images of infa*** started only a ***ple of days ago. And before that, he didn't seem to be collecting that kind of stuff, which is unusual for a high school boy of his age. ****king as a man myself, I have to say that this change is too drastic.
I feel like my head is about to boil from a very serious ****ysis of my sex life.
However, his boiling head was quickly ***led by the next words of Tara.
"This sudden distortion of his sexuality and incre**** sexual desire. Can you prove that this does not ****cate an aggravation of the curse that resides in his arms?
The curse, worse?　Of this arm?
Why are we talking about pedophilia and ****eased sexual desire being the result of climax expulsion?
It is now suspected that the existence of a monster that turns people into pedophiles is the reason for the sudden change in his sexual habits, and Kuzunoha's people will immediately proceed with the investigation.
I asked you if you could prove it!　I don't want to hear such nonsense!
Tara Blade's angry voice ***oed.
Kaede took his sudden rage as "expected".
If you're talking about proof, then you also can't prove at this point whet*** his curse is what you think it is.
It's ……true. The Audit Department also had a psychic vision of him, but we could only tell that his abilities were due to a mysterious spell. That's ……why it's so frightening. We need to ****cise the utmost caution.
What the hell do these people know?
I'm sure you're not the only one who has a problem with this.
The only way we can be sure of his ****cence is if the monster that turns people into pedophiles actually exists. ……No, even if such a monster does exist, the defendant was ***ble to resist and was ****ected to a brainwashing type of psychic disturbance. In fact, he is ****ably the lowest-ranking student at the Demon Academy. This is the reason why it is important for you to have a good idea of what you are looking for.
I admit that it is a sharp power, but psychic abilities are ****able and distorted. That's why demonologists work as a team to compensate for their shortcomings. Are you forge***** those principles?
Leaving me bewildered, the discussion continued on a ****llel track.
However, Kaede seemed to be pushing the argument a bit, and it was when I began to think that if things continued as they were, the guilty trial would set*** down to a slightly better conclusion.
"Well, that's a bit confusing.
……What? What?
Softly.
A semi-transparent woman landed right next to me. There was no sign of anything, just suddenly.
What……! 　No, that's impossible. What the hell is this? What the hell?
He wore a suit similar to those of the auditors, and his black hair was longer than he was tall.
It's hard to tell with her dead-fish eyes, but she's quite beautiful.
The woman smiles wryly next to my astonished face and gazes too proudly around the assembly hall.
What is this guy's curse? Is it the worse**** of the curse that cau*** him to become a pedophile, or is it something else? I'll give you a psychic reading. Thoroughly.
She said that she sounded like a demoness.
Master? 　I……'m on a business trip.
Sakura's voice trailed off.
"Why are you…… here?……
A bead of sweat trickled down Kaede's forehead, who had been arguing so ***nly until then.
　　　　　4
I've heard rumors.
It's a story about a genius who, despite not being from one of the "nine old families," showed tremendous talent and rose to the rank of Twelfth Master at a young age.
The woman was severely ***ured during one of her jobs and went into a vegetative state, but her talent did not stop there. But her talent didn't stop there. She was able to use astral projection to stay active for a long ***iod of time with only her soul, and continued to work as a demoness while focu**** on healing her body.
She is a rare living spirit demoness.
***tead, he lost the ability to use some of his techniques, which led to his demotion from the Twelve ****enly Masters, but he has more than made up for it and ****inues to reign at the top of the industry with his skills and special abilities.
"Sir. Did you have a good business trip?
"Idiot. There aren't many jobs that have a higher priority than the worsening of that curse.
Dire**** of the Audit Department. Nagisa, a technique crusher.
She answered Tara's question in an appropriate tone and grace***** flew up into the air.
I'm not sure what his curse is yet, but I'm pretty ……sure it's black.
"……Oh, no.
The eyes of a dead fish looked into mine from above.
The pressure was incomp****** to the previous time when I was targeted by a demon**** shota-con sister at the Ascension Support Center. When you are targeted, you can never escape and you can never resist. I'm not sure what to do, but I'm sure I'm not the only one.
The pressure was unexp*****ly directed at someone else than me.
"And before that...
"……Yes!
It was the auditor who had brought me here with Kaede who made me stiffen.
The two guys who mis*** me once.
"I hear you guys failed to catch this guy. How long have you been in the audit department?　Oh?
That's because Haruhisa Furuya has…… shown an ***nown power.
"There's also the protest of Inspector Buncho Sakura and the pres**** of Misaki Soya.
"Shut up. Solemnity.
"No, no, no, no, no! No!
At the same time as Nagisa began to run through the air, the two auditors ****oyed a technique with a ****owful expression. Hexagram multiple warding. The number of sheets and stre**** of the defensive bulkhead that is instantly deployed is incomparable to that of a student. However.
"I'll fall behind the students. I don't think I'm up to that level of skill.
We've slipped through the wards!
 ……No. If you look closely, you can see that the warding melted as soon as it touched Nagisa, and it seemed to have slipped through because it was done so instantaneously.
'Shall I punish you a little harder?　Hmm?
"Huh? !
Shururi.
Almost bypas**** the wards, Nagisa's spirit seemed to enter the middle-aged auditor's body.
"Well, brace yourselves, boys.
Nagisa's voice ech*** from the mouth of the middle-aged auditor. ****lete possession of a professional demon opponent!
No, no, no!　Please, sir!　Please don't do that... No!
The younger auditor tries to resist the middle-aged auditor in Nagisa, but... boom!
His body flew through the air and slammed into the ground.
Nagisa, who had ****essed the middle-aged auditor, gave the younger auditor a one-handed kick.
It was such a brilliant throw that the young inspector did not even twi*** as he immediately recalled that Sakura's elegant physical skills were still in their infancy.
Nagisa grabbed the auditor by the chest.
"'Here, be grateful. It's a hot kiss from your boss.
"～～～～!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !
Butchoooooooo! Pasha-pasha-pasha.
A middle-aged auditor uses his body to steal a young auditor's lips, and then takes a ser*** of photos of the scene with his smartphone.
I'm going to post the pictures on the bulletin board at the association headquarters for a while. Reflect on that.
Nagisa, who had slipped out of the middle-aged auditor's body, ***ured him without any mercy.
What was left behind were two *****ctors lying in a heap, looking as if they were about to commit suicide…….
I'm so scared of the Audit Manager!
What the hell was that?　It's not like there's anything wrong with a floating spirit that can't *****nicate with magic!
 ……Ha!　Are you okay, Sakura?　I'm worried that…… she'll get hurt like that for ****nding me.
"Are you sure Auditor Buncho Sakura is blameless?
Tara Blade had declared something unnece***** to Nagisa. I'll break your glasses, you bastard!
"He's okay. He's a lovely apprentice.
Long live partiality!
I'm a little bit of a boss, but whatever, as long as Sakura doesn't get hurt badly.
It was only a short time before I was relieved to know that Sakura's safety was guaranteed.
'Now then, finally the real deal. The next step is to see this guy.
Nagisa's evil hand, the one that forced the two auditors to kiss earlier, was closing in on me!
"Wait, Nagisa.
Kaede, who had been quiet until then, spoke up and ***pped Nagisa's hand.
But the expression on his face did not…… have the usual cleverness, and for some reason he looked very pale.
"He's already been given multiple psychic read**** by people from the auditing department. A new psychic reading now would be...
"Oh?　How much can you know with your trivial psychic vision?
Kaede's words were interrupted by Nagisa, who ***shed her hair back softly.
"Or is there something you'd like me to look ***per into?　It's the haunted fox Kuzunoha-sama.
I'm sorry……. I'm sure there are restrictions on the use of your possessed psychic vision because it is too powerful. If you use it without an official request, this is a clear violation of discipline.
'How dare you ***ture the head of the Audit Department on indiscipline? You're talking out of your ass, young lady.
Nagisa lightly brus*** off Kaede's point and nud*** her fingertips into my cheek.
……What? What?
A whimper. A feeling of fear ran through my body, as if my soul was being directly hit.
What?……
The only time you will be ****lized for the unauth****** use of a possessed vision is when the target is innocent and harmless. If you want to stop me, you should have quickly risen to the level of Twelve Master Heaven, young lady.
Zuzu, zuzu. Something enters my consciousness, and I start to lose track of it.
I'm sure you're not the only one. I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
If…… that's what you want.
A large amount of blue flames appeared around Kaede. However, the flames did not attack Nagisa.
"Master Kaede. Please hold it.
A woman wearing a fox mask stood in front of Kaede.
I'm sure you've *****ipated this situation. You can't stop her yet with Kaede-sama's ability, and here you have the eyes of the other old families. There is no ****ntage, and Kuzunoha will only jeopardize her position.
But!
"We have to trust in Father's seal here.
But……...
Is it an ****sion that that maple has a tearful expression on her face?
My consciousness and vision blurred, and the sounds that echoed through the courtroom became distant.
"Now, will the devil or the snake come out?
The only thing that echoed clearly in my consciousness was Nagisa's voice, and other than that, nothing else...
No!
Buzz!
This was the moment when another voice echoed in my head.
"What? What?
My consciousness, which had been completely blurred until then, was suddenly pulled back to reality.
Nagisa was floating in front of me, looking as if she had just encoun***** an extremely alien monster, and the previ***** tranquil courtroom was fil*** with a restless buzz.
"Nagisa-dono's possessed vision has been intercepted! What's happening? "What's the result of the vision? What's the result?
I was stunned and confused.
"Is this a sign…… of a descending……? A
Ama……, what is it?
Nagisa's voice is lost in the ***mor as she ruffles her own hair.
I'm not sure what's going on here, but I don……'t know ……what's going on. I'm not sure what to do.
Nagisa left me and flew toward Kaede, who looked more confused than anyone else in the room.
"That kid Haruhisa Furuya, is he really just a spirit disaster orphan?
"……What?
Kaede's voice sounded like she didn't know what the question meant.
The expression on his face was an ******ribable mixture of relief, confusion, and a pause in thought as he encountered an unexpected situation.
It was then that the atmosphere in the courtroom started to become chaotic, as no one could understand the situation.
Boom!
There was a roar of shock from above that shook the courtroom.
─ There is an emergency!　We have an emergency!
A panicked voice rang out from the speakers.
Misaki Soya, who is supp**** to be ***ned from the Association's headquarters, has ***aded the premises!　Staff, please take cover immediately!　Demons, please deploy the wards!
 ……He's as unreasonable as I am, isn't he?
It was all I could think about in my head, exhausted from the overload of information.
　　　　　5
"Whoa! 　What's with the ponytail? 　What's with the ponytail? I'm not sure.　Don't run away! Set up the next ward quickly! You can't!　You can't do that if they can see your face! She's the daughter of the Soya family. She can't use rough techniques! All those with families, back off!
I could hear such a commotion coming from the other side of the big door, and the sound was getting closer and closer to me.
"……What the hell?
While saying this, Nagisa stopped ****ering Kaede and sank…… to the floor.
"No, Kaede. Come here.
The woman in the fox mask urged Kaede to retr*** behind the curtain.
Tara Blade silently puts a physical ward on the large door and hides in the shadows of the courtroom.
A few seconds later, after everyone except Sakura and I had completed our counterm******* against Soya.
"Hold that trial for a second!
DOGASHAAAAAAAAN!
At the sound of Soya's voice, the physical boundary of the large door is blown away, and multiple figu*** appear from the dust.
The one leading the way is Nagumo, who ****tered the large door with the physical boundary of the Tathara blade. At his side, for some reason, was a ***pped up Karasuma, who was being held and was turning his eyes.
"I ……see. It's not a good match against a for*** spirit class 6.
Nagisa said from the bottom of the floor as Tara Blade groaned in frustration after her physical ward was broken.
So?　What do you think you're doing, you ***pid girl from Soya's place?
I have something to show the people in the audit department!
He didn't care that he was called an idiot, and raised his chee**** voice, the complete opposite of the serious atmosphere of the courtroom. Soya, whose breasts had been made smaller by exposure or something, took a step forward, perhaps in consideration of Nagumo's ability.
"I've got the little girl!
 ……He held up a young girl ***pped in a spherical ward with a sense of pride.
The heir of an old family kidnapped……? "Hey Soya!　What's going on with your family, every time! No, she's always been like that, so we'll just have to give up.
On the other side of the curtain, the people from the old family's auditing department were really buzzing.
If the heiress of an old family, who is the face of the demonologist industry, uses her spiritual power to capture a young girl, there will be an uproar.
But in this case, Soya is too good to be true.
What are you doing? 　What were you…… thinking, knocking into the executive board with a little girl?
Sakura, who was the only one who could get in front of Soya other than me who was blocked from moving, was the first to notice the change.
"What's wrong with her? She's not ……human.
Soya was holding up a young girl in a red dress.
Sakura's eyebrows furr**** when she saw his inorganic expression up close.
Yeah. I'm not human. That's why I couldn't see any sexual information in her eyes, so I was able to find her right away. I was in a hurry when Furuya-kun was caught, though!
Soya puffed out his chest with pride and argued his case to the court.
"This child is the end of some kind of monster…… that turns people into pedophiles!　Therefore, since Furuya-kun is not a pedophile, please cancel this trial!
That's ridiculous!　It's probably just Soya's shikigami disguised as a monster or something!
The first person to speak up was Tara, who was lurking in the shadows. He seems to want to impri*** me at all costs.
But my team members have been affected.
Soya pec*** Karasuma on the cheek.
"……M"?　Oh, it's a little girl!　There's a little girl!　Let me tie her up!　I've……? Oh!
As soon as Karasuma woke up, he got excited on his own.
What's with the little ham? That guy's dangerous.
"She's been reported to have a history of bad ****vior!　That's not evidence!
The many ***des of a sin*** sword.
What do you mean two out of the three members of the team are on the radar of the Audit Department? And the last one is banned from the association's headquarters. Even if I'm cleared of suspicion, there's no place for me in the industry, is there?
"Well, if they don't believe me, then I'll have to…… practice on someone else.
Soya ***sted his head and his eyes lit up when he ***tted the two auditors lying on the floor.
Wait, Soya?　Can you give those people a break already?
"Hooray.
But my prayers, ***ble to raise my voice, went unanswered.
Soya released some of the spherical warding, and took the hands of the two auditors to touch the young girl in the red dress. No questions asked, no answers. There is no such thing as prior confirmation. The next moment.
"Ugh, geez! 　What the hell is this? 　Stop it!　Quiet, my body…….
"I have a wife and kids.……? I have a wife and kids.
The two auditors looked at the young girl in the red dress and began to hold her lower body.
And Soya, perhaps antici****** this situation in advance, spread the printed secondary lolita image in front of the two auditors. She's a demon.
"……Yes!
***pite the fact that their bosses and colleagues were watching, the two auditors began to collect secondary loli images and even started to rub their cheeks, as if they were people thrown out into the des*** seeking water.
Seeing this, I felt a strong sense of *****mfort before thinking, "The existence of a monster that turns people into pedophiles has been proven! I had a strong feeling of discomfort before I thought, "Yay!
I thought, "Aren't these people beco**** too pedophilic?　I wonder.
"What the hell is this? It's not just Haruhisa ……Furuya, ……what's going on with this transformation?
Tarahira's voice was stunned.
It was the exact same question I had.
I had been able to ignore Karasuma's transformation because she was a pervert by nature. However, if both of the auditors are transforming as much or more than Karasuma, then I'm the one who's ……abno****.
Why am I getting away with this?
"……It's a little too forceful, but it seems that the existence of a monster that turns people into pedophiles has been proven. Let's call it the pedophile maker.
Kaede's voice, which had taken ***uge behind the curtain, echoed in the courtroom.
The agitation he had felt earlier seemed to have eased with time, and he was in his usual calm tone.
Also, although I don't know the theory, I assume that Haruhisa Furuya has repe**** the possession of the for*** Twelve Masters and is somehow allevi***** the psychic disturbance of the pedophile maker. What do you think, Nagisa-san?" "I don't see any reason to keep him locked up any longer, and the only thing that remains is his usefulness.
"……Do what you want. I'll let you off the hook this time.
"What, sir? 　It's…… that easy. What in the world did your psychic vision show you...
But there's one condition.
Nagisa told Kaede from the floor, interrupting Tara's protests that she was still unhappy at this point.
"You can do that after you get rid of the pedophile ***yer. Show your face at my place, Kuzunoha.
Let's do ……it. We have some questions for you as well.
It must be something about the curse on my arm.
Unbeknownst to me, something important has come to light about these hands.
But there was no way to confirm it now.
"Yes!　Furuya-kun's innocence is confirmed!　We won the case!　Thanks for your cooperation, Mutsumi!
I'm ****osed to be cooperating with you.
He was first to thank Soya and Nagumo, who were as happy as he was.
"And that asshole over there.
"Huh?
Right after the trial was over. Nagisa called out from underground to the soar*** Soya.
I'm sure you'll be able to figure out how to do it.
"Oh, my God, I'……m gonna be so mad.
 ……As expected, I'll go with you to get pissed off about that.
That's what I was thinking when I saw Soya in a depressed state.
Out of the cor*** of my eye, I saw a downcast Sakura ****ling out of the courtroom.
"Cherry…… blossoms?
I quickly chased after her, but there was no sign of Sakura in the inorganic underground corridor.
I wonder if it was my imagination.
Droplets of water that looked like tear tracks were rolling down the hallway, making faint stains.
　　　　　6
What the hell are these two hands?
One night after the decapitation trial, many questions were swirling in my head.
The power to remove spirits with a single blow, not just spirit class 6, but even spirit class 7.
A girl's voice comes in at the right moment to help me.
And the unusually harsh attitude of the leading figures in the auditing department.
That was a precaution that went far beyond the fact that the owner of the obscene ability to expel climax had become a pedophile.
Furthermore, he felt that it was not only because ……Soya had caught the pedophile maker that the alert had suddenly been put on hold.
I can't say anything rash about ……that because I'm still trying to sort through the situation.
Right after the trial. I asked Kaede about it during the regular checkup she gave me to make sure I was okay, but she gave me such a vague answer.
"For now, you can demons***** your usefulness to the Society by expelling the pedophile slayer. ……After that, there may be something I can tell you.
Hav*** said that, Kaede went in search of the host of the pedophile maker in order to prevent the pedophile slayer from ***sing more ***age. She searched for the thr*** of spiritual power that ****nded from the extrav***** young girl that Soya had captured, and identified the main body.
In many cases, such remote-controlled monsters have more than one end, so you can't feel safe just catching one ****nile alien.
(Well, defea**** the pedophile slayer was the original goal of our group, so we'll focus on that for now.
While I was thinking about it, what kept coming back to my mind was the exchange between Nagisa and Kaede.
(It's been like this for a while, but Kaede's been hiding something from me. About the seal*** of this arm.
Periodic checkups that have been half forced to be done.
My advice is to never let anyone know about the voice.
I had somehow taken it for granted, so I let it pass, but after experiencing the extraor****** caution that the Audit Department showed towards me, ……Kaede's attitude seemed inexplicable.
I'm sure you've heard of it, but I'm not sure if you've ever heard of it. It's like a doctor not expla***** a disease to his patient.
I don't know. Kaede is definitely scary and merciless, but she's not using me or anything like that. If she can't talk to me, she must have a good reason. I don't know what ……her real intentions are.
I kept thinking about things that I couldn't help but mull over, and that's when my thoughts started to loop.
"Hey, secondhand store!　You're losing focus!
"What? What?
A shinai was swung down on his brain.
"Yes, he's dead. You just got your head smashed in by a pedophile slayer and you're dead.
It was Nagumo, dressed in street clothes, who looked down at me dumbfounded as I held my head and cowered.
I've heard that you're not very good at demonology. I've heard that you're not very good at demonology, but you're not very good at body magic either. How did you manage to get rid of me?
No, you've been ****ning for two hours straight, and your concentration and strength are at their limits.
I was exchan**** these words with Nagumo in the indoor training area near the association's headquarters.
He is training with the kendo specialist Nagumo as a virt*** opponent before a confrontation with a weaponized monster, the Pedophile Slayer.
When the pedophile slayer actually appears, we plan to stop the enemy with the help of professional demon ****ping techniques and Nagumo's monstrous strength, but the pedophile slayer will always aim at the pedophile, which means me. Thus, training to dodge their weapons was a must.
But...
"What?　Two hours is just prep work.
I was going to be killed by a full-blown ****astic physical ghost before the pedophile slayer.
"I don't care if it's a club practice, it's a drill with your life on the line. I'm not going to cut corners.
"You know, if you say that and you end up with sore muscles or a broken leg in the show, there's nothing you can do.
"That's true, but... But if you're in the business of ****ting monsters, you should be more *****cally fit.
Nagumo exhaled a sigh as hard as he could.
Well, I can't argue with you on that.
Are ……you really that desperate for a break?
Nangumo muttered to himself.
That's what I'm talking about. I'm going to have to take a break if he does that to me. I don't want to do that.
I'm sure you'll be able to understand what I'm talking about.
You idiot!　What the hell are you doing?
We've just esca*** the Audit Department's decapitation trial!
What are you trying to do, take another break!
"Accident!　This was an accident during training, it's okay!
It's obvio**** intentional!
I mean, didn't you forget the one about Nagumo?
It's not just me and Nagumo in this place.
I've learned that there is a chaperone.
"Hey Sakura!　Don't just stand there, help me stop this thing!
"……What?
Sakura, who was looking down in the corner of the training area, looked up vaguely when she heard my voice.
He continues to work as my supervisor.
Incidentally, Soya is currently on a mission to iden**** and protect those who would have been turned into pedophiles with an emergency team formed by the association, ***nks to his ability to use his lecherous eyes. Karasuma, like the two inspectors, had been lightly impri***** because the pedophile could not be cured. It seems that until the pedophile maker itself is cured, the pedophile can't be released. It's a cursed kind of monster.
……What are you doing? 　What the hell are you doing? What are you doing?
"Cherry blossoms! Sakura!
I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but it's a good idea. I'm not sure what to make of it, but…… I think it's a good idea.
"I knew you were acting weird since yesterday. What's wrong with you?
It's ****lutely ridiculous that Sakura, who is ****osed to be trained in physical arts at a fai*** high level, can't even pass the test and falls down. I've been absent-minded since yesterday, and I didn't even bicker with Kaede, who gave me a regular checkup.
She left Nagumo lying on the ground like a mollusk, saying, "My big tits are shaking and I can'……t get any strength. She reaches out to help him up, but
I can stand on my own!
Sakura shakes off my hand and stands up, her face bright red.
Her face was so distorted that she looked like she was about to start crying.
Worried, I tried to open my mouth again, "Are you okay?
"Are ……you guys stupid enough to practice all the time without taking a break?
Sakura suddenly said this, and turned her back to me.
As if trying not to look like she was about to cry.
I'll get you something to drink, so you can take a break. "I'll buy you a drink, and you can take a break, because resting is part of the training.
He said and walked quickly out of the training area.
The words themselves were a good argument, though…….
"What's a watcher doing running from a target?……
I left Nagumo there for the time being and chased after Sakura.
I know I'm smoked out. I know they hate me.
But there was no way I was going to leave my sister like that.
　　　　　7
The cherry blossoms were easy to find.
Right next to the ***ding mach***, a short walk down the corridor after leaving the training area. He was sitting on a bench that was set up to hide behind a pillar.
Two bottles of sports drink were pla*** beside him as if they were an excuse.
The expression on Sakura's face was ***den by her hair, so I couldn't see her face.
"Uh...
For the time being, I chased after him, but I didn't know how to talk to him.
As I swept my gaze awkwardly, I suddenly ***tted something nostalgic in the ***ding machine.
……Oh, you liked that one, didn't you?
It was warm cocoa in a can.
When we lived together, I was often ****ered by the cherry blossoms when I went out in the cold season.
I ***ght a cup of cocoa with some coins I happened to have left in my pocket.
Just drink this and calm down.
I pointed the cocoa at Sakura, thinking that I would cry if she pla*** it.
But ****rary to my expectations, Sakura didn't pop the cocoa.
"Don't do that.……
What I heard instead was Sakura's small tremb**** voice.
"Don't be nice to me like that!　Stop spoiling me!
Not anger or irritation.
It was Sakura's earnest plea.
I'm sorry…….
So, ***ble to do anything more, I sat down next to Sakura, holding a cup of cocoa that was a little too warm for the season. A long ***ence follows.
……I was supp**** to be watching you, but I couldn't do anything.
Eventually, Sakura opened her mouth.
What I heard leaking out was a very frustrated voice.
The vixen was well-prepared and went toe to toe with Tara and the others. Misaki Soya found a pedophile maker and proved that you're not crazy. But for me, even when you were being treated strangely, I was just screaming and ***ning like a child.
"No, it's not.……
I hesi****d, wondering how I should respond to Sakura's unexpected confession.
When the auditor stepped into the room, Sakura did her best to protect me.
But I'm sure Sakura hates me, and I'm sure she hates me for being a pervert with the fucking ability to expel climax. So I don't know what's bothering Sakura so much.
"Don't worry about it. You don't have to worry about it, I've been exonerated like this. It's just that those two are crazy.
Kaede is, well, a substa***** ice woman by nature, and Soya is an idiot with a whore's eye. I'm grateful that they ****eved in the existence of the pedophile ***ers and captured them, but I don't think they're going to storm the association headquarters.
"Of course I care! Of course I care!
Did my casual comforting spark a fire?
When she looked up, Sakura's eyes were filled with more anger and irritation than usual.
"You know……, if I'd been better from a young age, maybe you and your foster father wouldn't have gotten into so much trouble without my knowledge!
"……Oh, no.
What came out of nowhere was a story about our parents who raised us.
They saved people as a matter of course, and spent most of the money they earned from their work on us orphans. Even after a hard day's work, they never showed any signs of fatigue and played with us - our parents collapsed from exhaustion and turned into ****rwear ghosts.
If I had been stronger, maybe your father would not have pus*** himself so hard until he collapsed. Maybe he would have compl***** and relied on me a little, and I wouldn't have ended up like that after he died.
"No, we're just as guilty.……
Also, I think it was 100% his fault, or fate, that his foster father became a pants ghost.
It's not just your foster father!
Sakura grits her teeth in frustration, ****ingly not listening to my words.
"I know, I know. I know that you were doing something with the people of Kuzunoha when your foster father went through that.
"Yeah…….
That's when I got rid of my foster father, who had turned into an evil spirit with a spirit level of 7.
I can kind of see it now. I'm sure you used your crazy powers to stop your foster father along with the foxes.
I'm sorry…….
I can't say anything. I'm not sure what to say, but I can't say anything. But Sakura continues with *****ction.
But at that time, I didn't know what to think. I was just dumbfounded, and before I ……knew it, my foster father's trouble was over. You came back in a state of exhaustion, and when I asked you what had happened, all you could do was cover it up. After that, you were always sneaking around with that fox. She didn't tell me anything. She didn't tell me anything about her foster father's exorcism or about the bracelet she had been wearing for a long time because ……I was too weak to protect her.
No, that's…… just plain embarrassing.
Because who can say that? Who can say, "I have the power to make people climax with a single thrust. I used that power to expel the spirits of my parents. It's impossible for a nor*** person's mentality.
But I'm sure that if…… I had been as good at evas*** as that fox, if I had been depen***** enough to be pampered by you, instead of being pampered by you, I wouldn't have been left out in the ……cold. I wouldn't have been ***ble to do anything about it because someone I cared about was in trouble without my knowledge.
"Cherry…… blossoms.
I wanted to say that wasn't true, but then again, I was the one who had actually done that.
"Don't give me that worried look!　Don't treat me like a sister!
When she couldn't continue, Sakura stood up from the bench like a bouncer.
I shouted with all my might, as if I were going to slap him.
I hate you for ****ting me like a child, for not teaching me anything important, for not ***ying on me.　I hate you! I hate you!
And so, breathing on her shoulders, she ****ched the hem of her dress.
……And I hate…… myself even more for being weak and whiny and letting you do that to me.
He let out a ***fled gasp.
So I'm not…… gonna take ****ntage of you now.
"……Okay.
That's when I finally realized Sakura's true intentions.
That would make me angry.
Sakura had always been worried about her own helplessness.
That's why two years ago, I went to train alone with that scary Audit Department manager.
He was actually able to do everything on his own, was doing a great job as an auditor, and was trying his best to insist on it. And yet, if I kept trea**** him like he was half the man he was, he would get angry. If I were in the same position, I would be angry too. If I were in the same position, I would be angry.
Sakura's harsh attitude was no surprise.
Yeah well, apart from that, the aversion about climax expulsion seemed genuine!
Well, anyway, so maybe the thing to do here is not to take comfort in the easy way.
You know, Sakura...
"……What?
Sakura glared at me as if she wouldn't understand if I said something bad.
"Oh, I don't know, maybe you could teach me how to, you know, move my body.
What?
"See, Nagumo is a good virtual enemy, but he's only a kendo specialist. He doesn't seem to know much about fighting in the flesh.
Also, I'm a fucking gymnast.
I've gone from being an amateur to being able to move that much in two years, and I need you to teach me too.
This may be a spoilsport to the cherry blossoms, though.
I sincerely tell Sakura that.
"……Oh, no.
When Sakura heard my words, she ***bed her eyes.
"Hmm, hmm. I can't help it.
She snatched the cocoa out of my hand with a strong look on her face, just like when we met again.
I'm doing you a favor, if that's what you're asking. You should be than**** me!
It was probably a bit hollow, but he seemed to have recovered some of his energy.
That's why we basic**** use half our body against weapons. I also keep my arms tight and my body small. It's like you're trying to reduce the ***face area of your body that your opponent can see.
On the way back to the training grou***, Sakura immediately gave me a verbal lecture on how to move my body.
Also, the advan**** of a weapon is not in its power but in its reach, so don't be afr*** to jump into the pocket. I'll show you how to do it later.
Naturally, this was also very ****entic and practical, and I could really feel that I had wor*** hard on my training.
I don't know anything about it.
When I said that with genuine admiration, Sakura turned her face to the day after tomorrow and said
"Hmm, hmm. You're the one who's crazy. You're the one who's crazy, because your lowest ability goes hand in hand with physical arts, and you haven't trained at all.
Well, I don't know what to say to that.
I didn't expect to have to use all these abilities, so I didn't build my body at all.
……But...
Sakura chuckles as she pushes open the door leading to the training area.
If you insist, I can take care of you, not just this time, but forever...
That's when it happened.
"Mr. Furuya. Get away from that girl.
"……What?
I heard the voice of someone who was not supposed to be there.
Kaede, who was supposed to be chasing the pedophile maker, was waiting for her at the training grounds with two ****mates and seve*** professional demons.
Nagumo also stood behind him, a puzzled expression on his face.
Then Kaede looked at me and Sakura, who was dumbfounded... no, she looked at Sakura.
She's a pedophile maker.
I held up the talisman.
　　　　　8
The monster is not aware that it is a monster.
Don't let people know that you're crazy.
The core of the ***tery lies deep within the soul and can only be disce**** through deep psychic vision.
I know that.
I was reminded of this when the breast-avoiding woman incident occurred.
But I still can't believe it. Cherry blossoms, a monster?
"It's always darkest in the light. But there's no doubt about it. The thread of spiritual power that stretches from the pedophile maker that Soya's daughter has captured is connected to you.
"Bullshit.……
Sakura muttered in astonishment, but…… the air of the gathered demons told her that it was no lie.
"But, but, I took all the precautions to prevent a monster crash!　Even…… the mental control, the ……self-checking as per the training.……
Still, I'm pretty sure you're the host of the pedophile maker.
Kaede approached us with the talisman in her hand.
"Be quiet. In the event of a monster crash, a full-fledged demon hunter should at least try to limit the spread of damage with as little *****tance as possible.
"……Oh, no.
Sakura ***ded silently in response to Kaede's stern but impl**** acknowledgement that Sakura was one of a kind.
That's fine. ……I'm sorry, but I can't immediately get rid of the spirit.
Kaede throws the talisman at Sakura's feet.
The technique he invo*** was designed to rest**** Sakura's movements.
"In order to lure the pedophile slayer, I need you to remain pedophile, Furuya. First, I'll do a deep psychic reading of you to check the prog**** of the monster, and then I'll seal it...
Kaede was about to activate the rest****ing technique while *****ining the measures to be taken.
Buzz!
"What? !
There was no warning.
Kaede's thrown talisman was flung away, along with the magic ***mula that was about to be activated.
For a moment, it looked as if Sakura had neutralized the technique, but...
What the...? 　Aaaaah! Aah!
"Cherry blossoms! Sakura!
A scream ***red from Sakura's mouth.
What the hell is ……t……? What?
Sakura held her head, her expression ****orted as if she was struggling.
Eventually, the light faded from his eyes, and a ***sma completely different from the one I had *****ienced in the past with a spirit level of 6 began to overflow.
"'Oh my god, they already know.'
What came out of Sakura's mouth, whose expression had disappeared, was a mysterious voice that was completely different from Sakura's.
It was sweet and somewhat joking. It was the voice of a girl, cute to the point of being out of place.
What the hell is this guy……?
"'Then that's enough. I'll give it all I've got.
I wondered if the mysterious voice had borr**** Sakura's mouth to make a throwaway declaration.
"Aaahhhh! !
Zuzu.
You've regained consciousness.
My eyes were glued to Sakura's screaming body as she gave birth to seve*** little girls. But what followed was a scene that drew my semi- pedophile gaze away from the little girls.
I'm sorry.
Something black burst out from Sakura's body.
It gradually took on a metallic sheen and covered Sakura's entire body.
He looked like a...
"Pedophile slayer! 
What the hell is this?
What the hell is going on?
"How long are you going to sit around, Mr. Furuya?
While everyone was stunned, Kaede was the one who immediately moved.
Kaede, who threw me out behind her with her fluffy beast tail, ran a large amount of foxfire to Sakura and instr***** her two teamm**** and the demoness to set up wards as well.
But.
……No!
Kaede's foxfire, and a number of advanced techniques that attempted to restrain Sakura.
It was as if some kind of barrier was blocking it from reaching Sakura, who was about to be swall**** by the jet-black armor. I'm not sure what to do, but I'm sure I'm not the only one.
That joke you just made, this unusual power... No ……way!
Kaede's expression twisted in shock and frustration.
"Unh, unh, unh, this is ……my ……power.……
I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that," said Sakura, who was about to be swallowed by the black armor, letting out a muffled cry.
They are ……resisting, their faces ****orted in pain. Against the erosion of the monster. With all his might.
"……Oh, no.
Almost reflexively, he took off his bracelet.
If there is a barrier around the cherry blossoms, then it is my hand that has culmi***** the auditor's ward.
But.
"Ugh! Ugh!　Why is ……this…… happening?　Not…… at all.
Sakura's resis***** was almost meaningless.
No,…… no……, no.
Sakura's body was swallowed by the black armor more and more until both her hands and her vision were ****ered inhuman.
I didn't even wait for the seals on my hands to be broken before I ran out.
"Sakura! Sakura!
Sakura's eyes, which were about to be covered by her black armor, were looking straight at me...
●
When she came to her senses after a moment of unconsciousness, Fumitori Sakura's entire body was enveloped in an unknown sensation.
My body and mind seemed to be engulfed by a pitch-black something that was *****iably rising from the depths of my soul.
At the mercy of the muddy negative energy, Sakura instinctively tried to stop the monster's erosion in the little consciousness that rema****. However.
What is this? This isn't…… a ……nor*** monster! What?
It was very different from the sense of weird**** I had been taught.
A monster is a psychic pheno***** that ari*** from the distorted negative emotions of its host. Therefore, no matter how abnormal and *****tating the *****ition is, the person who is engulfed by the *****ition is said to feel an elation similar to euphoria.
It is often descr**** as a feeling of surre**** or sentimentality, of anger or vengeance.
But what hit Sakura now was just an ******elming torrent of unpleasant black emotion.
Far from being euphoric, I felt as if I had been thrown out into the sea at night.
Clearly, this is no ordinary monstrosity. But still.
I'll take care of it. I'……ll take care of it.
We may not be able to ****ress the monster completely. However, we can delay the monsterization, even if only a little, and reduce the burden on Kaede and the others.
Thinking about this, I desperately tried to assemble and activate the magic formula in my fad*** consciousness. But...
"Ugh! Ugh!　Why is ……this…… happening?　Not…… at all.
*****tance was completely futile.
My body and mind were being swallowed by the black torrent, and I was losing more and more of myself.
It was only then that an overwhelming sense of dread came over Sakura.
A monstrosity that deve**** completely unknowingly and is not ****able to resistance techniques.
Even Kaede Kuzunoha was struggling to cope with the ever-shrinking field of vision and was unable to do anything about it.
What will happen to me if I am swallowed by this monster?
Can I be a person again?
Before I knew it, I had a long sword in my hand.
It's not a sweet monster that turns people into pedophiles.
This is a monstrosity that kills people.
No,…… no……, no.
"Sakura! Sakura!
What came into Sakura's sight was a boy rushing towards her with a desperate expression on his face.
I decided that I would never rely on them. I decided that I would never be spoiled. That's how I've been building up my strength.
I didn't want to be just a burden to be protected. I wanted to help the people I cared about.
However, the words were leaking out of Sakura's mouth almost on their own as her consciousness faded under the fear of being taken into a deep, botto***** darkness.
No! ……Help me...
●
"Help me, big brother!
"……Oh, no.
Sakura shouted, and the moment I reached for her.
Sakura's face was obscured by the helmet of her West*** armor - her huge body, which was over three met*** tall, instantly disappeared along with the young girls around her who had inorganic *****ssions on their faces.
"What the fuck is going on?
Right after that, I could only swear at the sudden series of events.
"You're in trouble, Mr. Furuya!
I rece***d an incoming call from Soya, who was supposed to be searching for and prote***** people who had been turned into pedophiles.
I'm not sure what's going on here…….
……No!
When I received the call from Soya, I began to move almost as if I were being played.
My head, my body, and my heart are so hot that I feel like they are going to burn off.
Help me, big brother!
I couldn't get rid of the fear in my sister's voice and face.
Chapter 5: Techno-Breaker
　　　　　1
"Nagumo!　It's Harugahara!
"What? Oh!
"You think you can carry me to Harugahara on your back? Can you carry me to Harugahara?
……Well, I'll leave it to you!　I can get up to two people there much faster than by car or train!
Nagumo, who quickly under***** my intentions, slapped my pad*** chest.
"Then take me and Kaede to Harugahara right now...
No, you must go to Harugahara alone first.
Kaede walked past me and kneeled down in the space where Sakura had just been.
I have things I need to do here.
He took what looked like a brush from his two teammates who were standing aside and began to draw a magic circle around the fading mia***.
I'm the first one to go.……? I'll go first.
You must have felt the miasma that completely repelled our attack.
A bead of sweat trickled down Kaede's cheek.
His voice and expression were even col*** than usual. His voice and expression were colder than usual, but the atmosphere he wore was more urgent than ever.
"It's not just a class 5 or class 6. It's a sign of demons.
"What……? !
When she was bewildered by the name of the spiritual ***reme being that suddenly ***ped up, Kaede continued to speak quickly as if she was telling ***self and the people around her. Her hand was even ***cker than that, drawing a magic circle.
It's probably a big deal, with an international bounty on its head. There's no way Kuzunoha or anyone else could have missed that sign. It is my duty to preserve this miasma so that I can track down the original demon. Gold fox!　Sil*** fox!
"Ha!
Kaede sharply instructed her two teammates who were suppo***** her in crea**** the magic circle.
Requ*** the Twelve Heavenly Hosts to be dispatched immediately. Speed is of the essence. I don't care who you are, as long as you can come as soon as possible. We're a little short on strength, but I'm sure Nagisa-san is still at the association. At least pull her out.
"Yes, sir.
After watching the two teammates disperse, Kaede looked back at me.
So hurry up and go to that little girl, just you!　Go to her!
……Okay. Okay.
As if pulled back by Kaede's uncharacte********** raspy voice, I took Nagumo's hand.
Please, Nagumo!
Hey!　Hold on tight!
Be careful not to inadvertently poke at Nagumo's ****sure pore, which glows in your alienated vision.
I leaned my body against the ***ple back of Nagumo, who was still in her sweat-soaked street clothes.
"Well, I'm pretty sure Harugahara is in this direction…….
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa!
It wasn't a lukewarm ***ler coaster.
Rapid acceleration.
A ****eral floating sensation that turns your insides upside down.
The scenery ***wed quickly.
Even though Nagumo was able to catch most of it, the impact of the landing still pierced through my body.
I was groggy within a few minutes as Nagumo moved across obstacles such as houses, rivers, and highways with an inhuman physical ability.
I don't know, man. I don't know.
Nagumo muttered to himself as he checked the direction on his phone while moving.
"I thought you said Buncho Sakura was a pedophile maker. How can there be two monstrosities in one person?
This was a natural question for Nagumo, who had only been in the world of demons, or spiritualism, for a short time.
……I don't know much about it, so I can only give you a rough idea, but I think the pedophile slayer was a marking type of monster, not a street monster type.
"Marking type?
"Yeah. You know how ghost ***ries go. You know those ghost stories that say if you see them, you will die in a few days, or they will take you away. You know, the ones that say if you see them, you'll die in a few days, or they'll take you away, or they'll harm you in time.
"Ah, there you are, that grim ghost.
In the old days, the head**** knight Dullahan was said to foretell death. More recently, there has been an ****reak of the "eight-foot-sama" monster in some rural areas. It's a ***arre pheno***** that is the result of shota-kon.
"The pedophile maker wasn't ****cking pedophiles, it was attac**** those who had been marked as pedophiles. Because of the complicated procedure, it's a very powerful monster for its class.
Perhaps because her true iden**** was discovered, Sakura hers*** had become a pedophile slayer, but…… until then, pedophile slayers, like pedophile ***ers, probably attacked people away from their host, Sakura. It was a very rare, remote-controlled monster.
It's a monstrosity that seems ……to have been designed to do just that.
In addition to that.
Normally, the person who is swallowed by a monster would say or do something crazy like Nagumo did, but I didn't see any such behavior in Sakura. This is not a normal monster, like the existence of the demon tribe that Kaede mentioned.
Kaede must have sensed this and that's why she rushed me.
The more I thought about the situation calmly, the more I couldn't help but worry about what had happened to Sakura.
How much farther to Harugahara?
She was also frustrated by the fact that she was only being carried on her back, and asked Nagumo.
Then Nagumo smiled triump****** and said
We're only seconds away.
Point forward with your gaze.
"I see it, Harugahara Station.
　　　　　2
"Whoa, what the hell?……
The plat**** of Harugahara Station. When he landed on the roof of the plat****, Nagumo let out a cry of dismay.
The platform of Harugahara station is on the second floor, and from there you can see the main street ***nked by various commercial facilities.
Harugahara, which is a *****trian mall on holidays and a busy place even on weekdays in the evenings like now, had fallen into a tremendous mess.
"Mommy, Mommy, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy.
"Come on, come on, come on!
Hordes of little girls in red, blue, and yel*** one-piece dresses walked around with the exact same faces and the exact same smiles on their faces.
"So cute. Little girls are so cute.
I'll give you some candy.
"Come on, let's do it!
Did a large number of pedophile ***ers contact random people?
Ordinary people, young and old, male and ***ale, were froli***** with mass-produced juvenile girls and pedophile ***ers with happy expressions on their faces. A lot of crazy smiles were ****ming on the main street.
Ladies and gentlemen!　It's not safe for you to be here, so get out of here... Damn it!　Those pedophile bastards!　They put the little girl before their own safety and won't listen to me!
"If there are any more pedophiles, we won't be able to handle them!　First, we have to get rid of the pedophile makers...
"You're ****cking them? 　But that's...
"Keep your mind on it!　That's not a real little girl, it's a monster!　Besides, if we don't get rid of the pedophile maker, we won't be able to get rid of the pedophile slayer!
It's probably to avoid contact with pedophile manufacturers.
There were several groups of what looked like professional demons ***dled together off the main street, deploying wards, and I could see that they were having a hard time dealing with the situation.
What they're looking at...
"Pedophiles must…… be ……destroyed.
There they are!　Cherry blossoms!
It is about a hundred ***ers straight down the main street from the station.
In the middle of the scramble inters****** where the other main street intersected, I saw a huge, shiny black figure. It was Sakura, who had turned into a pedophile slayer.
Its huge body was so *****icuous that it was clearly visible even from the station platform. Perhaps because it had taken in its host, Sakura, its body was even bigger than when it had attacked me. It was twice as big.
The area around the pedophile slayer is also in a terrible state.
Just like the main street, there were many young girls and pedophiles playing around, making it look like a fest**** in a pedophile's paradise.
And to all those pedophiles out there...
"Pedophiles…… must…… die.
The longsword carried by the pedophile slayer ***shes sideways.
"……Oh, no.
Just when I thought the ordinary people, who were so ****rbed in the little girl that they didn't even show any sign of running away, were about to be reaped.
Gumball!
The pedophile slayer's sword bounced off the wall as if it had hit a wall.
If you look closely, you can see that a semic***** of wards had devel**** around the pedophile slayer, narrowly blocking her from striking.
A good demonologist is setting up a solid ward from somewhere far away. However.
Boom!　GAGGON!　Doggone it!
A series of blows from the pedophile slayer easily cracked the wards. Each time, the wards are repaired, but…… I don't know how long the spiritual power of the ****erer will last with that.
"Nagumo!　Can you get all the way up there? "Nagumo!
"The shor**** way is to approach through the buildings and drop the ****iles from the roof of the near*** building.
That's it, please!
"Heck, you should have shown that kind of guts in training!
As he was saying this, Nagumo put a lot of pressure on his legs.
"Whoa……! Oh!
Gura.
As Nagumo's body loses strength, I fall from the roof of the platform... isn't this the kind of thing that kills both me and Nagumo?
"Ugh, so many big tits shaking, no…… power.
In the middle of the fall, in a vision that ***wed time like a running clock. In the lollyg****** crowd, I could see some big tits. The fruit ***yed and bob*** as they played with the young girls.
He's not a monster, he's a tit detector!
Damn it!　As I twisted in midair, I ……thought that I should at least put my alienated hands down to reduce damage as much as possible.
『『『『 is the catch! 』』』』
"Whoa! Whoa!
Gah!　Suddenly, a strange force in the air stops me and Nagumo from ***ling.
We were rescued by four girls who were deformed into two-headed figures.
They were Soya's shikigami, who imitated the four gods.
However, it seems that Soya's shikigami, which has a spirit class rating of 1, is not powerful enough to carry me and Nagumo to the top of the arc*** as if we were gliding.
Mr. Furuya!　You're here!
Upper part of the arcade.
Just after I landed on the back side of the sign.
Soya, who was wearing a school uniform, came running up to him along with several other demons. Her large breasts swayed along with her trademark ribbons, causing Nagumo's body to relax even more.
"Ugh, looks like I can only help so much.……
Nagumo muttered in regret.
Well, I can't wrap myself around big tits in a crowd of pedophiles, can I……?
It was quite a blow to have Nagumo leave here, but it was enough to bring us to Harugahara in a matter of minutes.
"Oh, no. You came all this way with Mr. Furuya, but if Mutsumi is like this, there's not…… much point.
"Soya.
What?
He asked Soya, who had begun to take care of Nagumo, to get a proper grasp of the current situation.
"If you're here, that means there's a special team in Harugahara to find and protect people who've become pedophiles, right?
The ones who called for the pedophiles to evacuate, the ones who set up wards around the pedophile slayers, and the ones who are with Soya now are probably the special team of demons.
Yeah, I know, but we've been completely divided by the massive outbreak of pedophile manufacturers…….
Soya looked down the main street from behind a sign and looked at the pedophileized crowd with a lost look on his face.
In addition, the people who were in charge of the special team were unlucky enough to be at the point where the pedophile maker originated, so even the chain of command has collapsed. Oh, by the way, the one rubbing cheeks with the pedophile maker there is the former ***tain.
"Whoa.……
I looked at the direction Soya was pointing and couldn't help but let out a squeal.
In the middle of the crowd, and from quite a distance, there was a conspicuous old man, clearly not dressed like a normal person, playing with a young girl.
A stern old man in his ***ties rubbing his cheek against a little girl and stret***** out his nose is not good. If only that part is cut out and reported, the association will be dismantled.
However, that's not important right now.
Soya, do me a favor.
I can't help but stare at pedophile makers and two-headed gods.
"I don't care if you use your family's connec***** or use your whore's eyes to make me look weak. Just give orders to all the demons in this place.
The demons behind Soya's back jumped their shoulders with a "jump".
I need all of you to work together to get me to Sakura.
"Sakura,……? "Sakura?
Affirming Soya's astonishment, I continued.
If we keep warding off the pedophile makers, we should be able to navigate the pedophile sea without ****ming pedophiles.
Soya would be on board.
That was what I had hoped to propose, but Soya assured me, his expression clouding.
We've thought about ……it, but I don't think it's possible.
"Why? The team of demons I just saw over there was trying to do the same thing.
So the plan ……was to take ****ntage of that and gather our forces in one place.
"What? 　What team is that? What team is that?
Soya's eyes widened in panic and he shook my shoulder gingerly.
And I was too far away to see much.
It's not good!　It'll absorb it again!
It was when Soya, ****ting, took out his phone and started *****cting every one of them.
Aaaaah!
A scream came from the pedophile-ized crowd.
I turned my head toward the main street, thinking, "Are the demons from earlier killed? 　I turned my head toward the main street.
"It's a little girl. It's a ……little girl.……
The one who was screaming was an ordinary man who had been turned into a pedophile. In his arms was a pedophile maker who had been made to stop functioning by demonology, and his figure was ****bling to pieces.
The people around me were at a loss for words in the face of the sudden violence, and their faces were soon tin*** with anger.
The brunt of the attack was on the demons who had taken up a fighting stance inside the wards.
How could you ……allow a little girl to do that?
"YES Lolita NO Violence…….
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
A large number of pedophiles stormed into the ward, causing the demons who had been working out their magic inside to scream.
Squad leader!　What the hell……? What do I do?
Don't be afraid!　The other party is a civilian, but I will consider it possessed and allow you to use your demonic arts!
But there are too many of them……!
The dome-shaped ward made a sickening noise as it was assau**** by pedophiles. Still, we managed to ****stand the tidal wave of pedophiles.
Huh.
"……What?
It was an instantaneous event.
As soon as the talisman that flew from somewhere touched the warding, the warding collapsed too quickly, and it was too late.
「「「「 GYAHHHHH! 」」」」
More than a dozen professional demons were swallowed by a crowd of angry pedophiles.
 ……Eventually, after the wave of pedophiles receded, they emerged.
"The little girl is so ……cute…….
"Okay, okay, let's go eat something delic**** together.
Those degenerates who hold hands with pedophile makers and smile sloppily!
"Huh. It's outra***** that a demon master would lay a hand on a little girl.
The one with the smug look on his face saying something *******ligible is the former captain who was rubbing his cheek against the pedophile maker earlier.
Did he just break the boundary? No way.
No, not just that ex-captain.
Seve*** pedophiles, who seemed to be demons, held up the same *****ction and were alerting their surroundings while ***ing on the pedophile maker.
You see?　Do you understand?　Don't provoke the pedophile.……
Soya covered his face with a somber expression.
"If we put in a half-hearted effort, they'll just absorb it. Do we look for someone with the ability to reach the pedophile slayer at once, or do we wait for enough support to eradicate the pedophile for sure?……
I'm sorry…….
This is such a big deal.
As in the case of the milk-avoiding woman, the association is probably gathering demons from around the area.
But this time, I don't have as much time as I did with the milk-avoiding woman.
The wards that prevented the pedophile slayer from ****cking would not hold for very long.
If we wai*** for ***kup to arrive, the number of casualties would be more than a hundred or two hundred.
If that happened, I'm sure Sakura wouldn't be able to recover.
I ……understand. Then Soya and the others will wait until backup arrives.
What about us? ……Furuya-kun! 　Where are you going? Where are you going?
I'm going to Sakura's.
Without hearing Soya stop me, I was ***ping off the arcade.
"Aah!" "Onii-san!
"Let's play together.
Then a pedophile maker flop*** over here.
He ***ches my arm with his tiny hand, trying to make me feel like a pedophile.
But...
"Sorry, man. I'm already a pedophile, I guess.
My eyes were glued to the ground, but I didn't hesitate to shake the little girl off and kept running straight.
I knew it.
I don't know what the principle is, but the pedophilia curse doesn't work as well on me as it does on others. No matter how many times I am touched, I am only pedophilized to the extent that my gaze is attracted.
In other words, they can push forward in the flesh without fear of the curse of pedophilia.
If I'm alone.
And we must choose the means.
"What? 　What the hell is that? 　He pushed a little girl! He pushed a little girl!
Take her down!　Loving a little girl is the same as *****cting her!
The pedophile-ized public noticed me and attacked me to protect their pedophile makers.
I'm sorry…….
If there were other, more moderate and reliable means, I was all for it.
But if…… you don't, you don't get to choose the means.
We have to save Sakura as soon as possible.
The one who even shed tears of regret, saying that she would never take advantage of me.
I told him to help me. Clearly.
You're in my ……way.
Hold up the middle and ring fingers of both hands.
I look at the ****sure aphrod***** hole that glows in my alienated vision.
The other party is just a civilian being controlled by a monster?
Is it important to use your abilities and your behavior because you are encha**** by a fucking curse?
If I abuse the climax expulsion, will the Audit Department or Kaede kill me?
I don't care about that, man!
Get out of the way!　Get out of the way, you pedophiles!
"I'm not going to be able to do it. !
Push*** down on the oncoming pedophiles, I waded through the sea of pedophiles.
　　　　　3
Poke. Poke, poke, poke. Poke and poke and poke.
"Ohhhhhhhhhhhh! !
The man in the suit falls to his knees as if looking up to the heavens, his hips ****ling and collapsing. Next.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! !
The big-boobed lady dressed as a maid leans back to ***ose her white throat and *****tedly twitches while ***wing a mysterious liquid. Next.
"Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God! ♥?
A high school girl with glasses is lying on the ground with her legs cramped, her soaked underwear expo*** as she wriggles her hips. Next.
"If you don't want to climax, stay back!
It was no longer a task.
I poke the plea**** pores that float in the bodies of the pedophiles who are *****aching me, and make them climax under one blow.
Maybe it was because I was a semi-paranoid pedophile, but I was able to concentrate on making the next person climax without being *****acted by the fact that girls my age were climaxing.
There were already dozens of people, maybe even over a hundred, lying on the path I had taken, spewing a mysterious liquid. Not just a bunch of dead people, but a bunch of people.
Even though it was outdoors, I could smell the mixture of male and female bod*** fluids and pheromones in the air, and it was making me dizzy.
Crap.
It was depressing to see the blood on my hands and face.
However, he had no time to worry about such things, and he made the pedophiles who blocked his way climax equa*** without question, *****dless of age or sex.
"What the hell is this? What the hell?
It's a pervert!　It's a perverted vermin!
It seems that the people who have been made into pedophiles by the pedophile maker are not completely brainwashed, and they are doing their best to be dismi***** when they see what I can do.
This had cau*** a great deal of disruption in his efforts to seize me.
That's right. From the other side, it looks like I'm making someone else climax with just a random thrust of my body.
You don't want to be around that guy if you can help it. I'd run away, too.
Take advantage of the gap and make many more climax. For those whose ******isiacs are on their backs, hug them, look over their shoulders, and poke their *****disiacs as if you were giving them a hug.
Don't be afraid!　Hurry up and seize it! What?
I can't let this pervert anywhere near a cute little girl!　I'm never going to lose! I can't lose!
No! No!　At least get the little girl somewhere safe!
"Keep this pervert away from my little girl!
While the pedophiles were attacking me, I took the initiative to keep the pedophile makers away.
I appreciate it.
I was so focused on the little girl that it was hard to poke my plea**** pore.
Now we can focus on getting rid of you.
Hyun... bang!
"Aah!
and the restra***** technique was activated on one of the pedophiles in front of me.
A number of talismans were obviously thrown at me, but they hit the pedophiles in front of me and ended up being misfires.
"Crap. The crowd's getting in the way!
A little ahead of me in the direction I was going were the ****ains of the special team who had been the first to be turned into pedophiles. It seems that they tried to inter**** with me, just as they had destroyed the wards of the demons who had expelled the pedophile maker earlier, but they couldn't get a clear shot because I was blen**** in with the crowd alone.
Apparently, the pedophiles as a whole do not have a high level of control.
(They're ……just in our direction. We'd better get rid of them as soon as possible.)
If left unchecked, you never know when you'll be caught off guard from a distance.
"I'm going to go to ♥♥♥♥...? !
Be cool-headed. Be matter-of-fact. Because that's what it takes to achieve your goals.
He clim**** and clears the way for several men and women in front of him at once, then bends down and blends into the crowd.
The pedophile who ***ices my ****ence and interferes will be climaxed accordingly, and I will be able to flesh out the former captains.
Hey!　They're getting closer!
……No, no, no, no, we're warded for now!
Physical wards were built around the former captains, pushing the people around them away.
I'……ll make you climax with one blow.
There was no certainty that an inorganic climax that *****ested only *****ularly would be possible.
But my hands were strangely hot from earlier.
I was tired from the training with Nagumo, and to be frank, it was quite hard on my body.
However, only the hands that have been transformed into human beings are puls*** strongly, and they are somehow ***thed in heat, as if they are filled with energy.
I bet you could use an inorganic climax. Now I can do it again and again. That was the only premonition I had.
I stare at the wards as I run to the former captains.
I ……see you!
I immediately poke the ****sure aphrod***** hole of the ward. In order to escape from the former captains who try to throw *****ction through the wards, he blends back into the sea of pedophiles.
Boom!
""Hmm?"
The next moment, the wards were shaking and the former captains tilted their heads.
Beep, beep, beep!
The ward, which should have been strong, shuddered greatly and became loose and wriggling.
The crowd that had just been pushed away leaned against it, causing the physical boundary to pop. Just like the one that blew up my room just the other day.
"What the hell? !
It was not a very big explo****, probably due to the original strength and scale of the wards.
But it was enough to throw everyone into chaos...
"Huh? !
I thrust my fingertips into the ****sure pits of the pedophile demons who were lying there.
"I'm not going to be able to do it. !
Next.
I began running again through the sea of pedophiles, which had become easier to navigate due to the confusion caused by the explosion of the physical boundary.
　　　　　4
"Aaaaaaahhhh! !
A group of college girls collapsed with their hips stic**** out in the air, spraying a large amount of water as they fell.
If you look in the direction where the tide was spouted, you will see a sudden opening of space. ……
"Ha, ……ha, ……finally.
After much ***ing and prodding, I finally got there.
How many minutes did it take us to cross a road that was only a hundred or two hundred ***ers long?
In the ***ter of the crowd, in a place as open as an arena.
"Pedophiles must…… be ……destroyed.
The black-armored monster, several meters tall, wielded a longsword and easily made a huge crack in the solid warding.
But the cra*** healed quickly, and he was prote***** the pedophiles from the pedophile slayer's deadly blade.
That's ……close. You're just in time.
The cracks in the wards will not heal.
The surgeon's spiritual power had finally run out.
"Pedophiles…… must…… die!
Tëm, Bagheerai!
The warding collapses nois*** as the pedophile slayer gives chase.
The red light peek*** out from the helmet like a single eye turned to the pedophiles playing with the pedophile maker.
There is no longer a wall protecting them from the deadly blade of the pedophile slayer.
Now that we can't expect any proper reinforcements, there's no way to fix the situation without hurting anyone.
I have no choice but to exorcise the pedophile slayer with my own hands.
I'll help…… you.
I ran as fast as I could towards the pedophile slayer, who was even bigger than when I first encountered her.
His body was exhausted from the training with Nagumo.
Her whole body was screaming as she ***wed through the pedophiles and rushed this far.
Unknowingly, my body was in shambles, and maybe once I sat down, I couldn't get up again.
Still.
"If you're a pedophile, I'm right here!
I shouted at the pedophile slayer who was holding a longsword to a civilian.
"Pedophile. ……Kill…… him.
The pedophile slayer turns to me and holds his sword high above his head, ready to crack my head open.
He was almost frightened by the attack that would end if he took a blow.
The advantage of a weapon is its reach rather than its power, so it's important to jump into the pocket without fear.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa!
Without hesitation, but rather with even grea*** acceleration, he jumped into the bosom of the pedophile slayer.
(Sakura, that's the first thing you taught me about how to prepare for a weapons fight!
Doggoshaaaaaaaaaa!
Right behind me, the asph*** ****odes in a huge explosion.
The pedophile slayer's outrageous blow shatt**** the ground, sending up a cloud of dust.
The blast ****elled me through the crotch of the pedophile slayer, and I leapt behind her.
Perhaps because it has taken in the main body of the cherry tree and grown to a huge size, its attack power has ****eased considerably. But it's also bigger and a little slower in its movements.
(Now if only…… the aphrodisiac hole was in a place that was as easy to penetrate as possible.
The difference in body size. I'm not going to lie, it's…… pretty tough when you have a plea**** hole in your head.
(As I recall, the last time I encountered her, there were no plea**** pores on the front or sides of her body.
The ****sure aphrodisiac hole will not change its position unless you poke it once.
I couldn't see the aphrodisiac when I confronted it head-on now, and it must be somewhere in the back.
"……Oh?
I rub*** my eyes.
But no matter how many times I checked, I couldn't find any plea**** pores on the back of the pedophile slayer...
"Pedophile. ……Unacceptable.……
I took another look at the front of the pedophile slayer who looked back at me, but I couldn't find any pleasure apholes.
What the fuck is going on? What's going on?
There is no pleasure aphorehole!
Or are they in hard-to-see places like armpits or soles?
"No ……way.
I had a bad feeling and quickly looked away.
Climax expulsion is the ability to make a person climax by poking the pleasure aphrodisiac hole that has appeared on the target's body.
The *****urable aphrodisiac hole can be seen from the top of her clothes and can be poked from the top of her clothes to make her climax.
But.
What if the other person is dressed in a thick costume, like a stuffed animal, that you can't reach with your fingers?
What if the opponent is a giant monster, three or four meters tall, with armor on top of that?
"……Oh, no.
When I look into my eyes, the number of pleasure pores in my field of vision increases dramatically.
This is because we can see pleasure pores not only in living things, but also in cars, streetlights, buildings, and the ground.
In that unusual vision.
"Pedophiles must…… be ……destroyed.
The armor of the pedophile slayer was ***ning with the light of countless pleasure ***nic pores.
Each piece of armor that covered the pedophile slayer had a pleasure hole ***ning through it: the helmet, breastplate, elbow pads, baskets, thigh pads, knee pads, shin pads, and perhaps even the backplate and buttplate.
That is to say.
"You mean we have to get rid of it to reach the cherry blossoms? What?
"Pedophiles must…… be ……destroyed.
"What? What?
As I stopped in confusion, a longsword was raised above my head.
"Damn it!　I'll have to try it anyway!
He jumps into the pedophile slayer's pocket again and ducks the attack.
And just before I walked past it.
"Ooh!
He ****tched out his arms and just bar*** reached. I poked the glow*** pleasure aphrodisiac hole in the pedophile slayer's thigh pad.
However, the one action that I added to poke the pleasure aphrodisiac hole was fatal.
Doggoshaaaaaaaaaaaa!
"Whoa! What?
The ***halt exploded much closer than before, and I was engulfed in a huge amount of dust and wind.
He lost his ***ance and rolled on the ground, and his body, which was at its limit, was severely dama*** by that.
"……Gosh.
B-beep!　Tëm!
As I raised my head to get up, my ears caught an unnat**** shaking sound that resembled a human body convulsing.
It was the sound of the pedophile slayer's thigh pads climaxing and falling to the ground. It was the sound of a pedophile slayer's thigh pads climaxing (?), bursting open, and falling to the ground.
And from the thighs of the pedophile slayer who had lost her thigh pads - the bottom of Sakura's shins were exposed.
Just as I thought, damn it…….
There are no pleasure pores in Sakura's feet, which seem to be attached to the black spiritual substance that forms the pedophile slayer.
But if you peel away the other armor, you will find a pleasu***** aphrodisiac somewhere.
Worst case scenario, if we pull down all the armor, we'll find it someday…….
"……Fuck.
I managed to get up, but my body was a wreck.
I felt as if the ****otics in my brain, which had been secreted tha*** to the non-stop progress I had been making, had been cut off once I fell to the ground.
"Pedophiles…… must…… die.
The pedophile slayer swung his longsword wide, and this time he tried to finish me off with a side-swipe.
It was doubtful that he would be able to dodge this blow, let alone pull off all his armor.
I've come this far to face my sister, who asked for my help.
I can't…… just give up.……
One or two things. I took a weak step forward, aiming at the pedophile slayer again.
"Hahahahahahahaha! Hahahaha!
From afar, the high-pitched laughter of an idiot who was not supposed to be here roared.
It's great!　The little ham girl is really great!　They're so hot!　School kids are the best!
It was a strange voice that made me question the decency of the owner of the voice, and it sounded like the police would be there in two seconds.
"……What?
Then, four ****enly maidens descended from the sky.
The eight-headed beauties resembling a blue dragon, a genbu, a vermillion sparrow, and a phoenix, resp***ively, appeared to cover the pedophile slayer's vision.
And one of those nym*** looked back at me.
Damn it!　Furuya-kun, you're being too reckless by yourself!　You're being too reckless!
In Soya's voice, he shouted.
We're a team, remember? We are a team!
　　　　　5
"Pedophile, ……kill him!
The longsword of the pedophile slayer, blocked from view, clea*** the space off target.
Zgun!　Dogan!　Boom, boom, boom!
After that, the pedophile slayer was still at the mercy of the eight-headed shikigami, who str*** down their longswords in the dark.
In the meantime, one of the eight-headed gods dragged me to a position where the pedophile slayer's attacks couldn't reach me.
I'm sorry it took me so long to get here!　It took me a while to make the shikigami look big enough to not attract pedophiles!
While ****king in Soya's voice, he flattened the healing talisman in his hand over my entire body.
"It was given to me by a professional, so I'm sure it'll do the trick!
Just as Soya said, my body feels a little more comfortable from the side of the talisman.
Apparently, Soya had also been preparing to support me after I had moved on my own.
Thank you for that. I'm very grateful.……
"Ha-ha-ha-ha!　So cute!　Elementary school kids are so cute!　I want one for my room decor!
Why is that pedophilized pervert here!
It's like they're shouting something that could get them arrested for overstepping their ***nds of freedom of expression!
I thought you said you were locked up!
When I turned my head toward the voice, I found Karasuma standing on the rooftop of a building that lined the main street, screaming excitedly.
……You can't really see it from a distance, but it looks like they're making a mark, so they must be *****ating some sort of light rope bondage.
The current Karasuma is only supposed to be excited by little girls, which means that he is tying up only one pedophile maker. What the hell is the point of that?
As I was ****iving first aid with a protection charm, the pedophiles around me suddenly started to buzz.
Hey!　There's a little girl tied up!　Damn it! 　I can'……! I can't touch her!
"This is where we demons come in!　 ……Huh?　What the hell is this powerful restraining technique? 　Is this the work of a monster? What is it?
"Hey, look at that!　It's that pervert over there making nonsense noises!
I'll stop him!　I'll stop him!
A group of pedophiles, their eyes changing color as their young girls were tied up, began to rush into the building where Karasuma was.
"Mmm-hmm. Just like we planned!
Soya, who seemed to be overlooking the situation from somewhere, smiled wryly.
As if to answer my question about what the plan was, sound and light burst forth.
Bash!
"Whoa! Aah!
From somewhere, multiple talismans flew out and str*** the pedophile slayer.
A pale blue light enveloped the pedophile slayer, slow*** her movements, if only slightly.
"Who's ***ing this……? "Who's flying this?
The people who had set up wards around the pedophile slayer should have already lost their spiritual power, and this area should be dens*** ****lated with pedophile makers and the pedophiles who protect them, making it impossible to get close to them.
'Hmmm... It's because of Aoi-chan's ability to attract pedophiles that the way was made!　I'm on my way!
Soya said, making the eight-headed shikigami look smug on purpose.
Looking back, I can see that the crowd at the end of the main street has thin*** out, as the pedophiles are rushing into the building to get to Karasuma.
They must have approached us through there. There were several demons ***ning out of the windows of a building much closer than the one Karasuma was in, and they kept throwing protective charms to cover us.
"Hee hee. It was well worth the effort to get Aoi out of the audit department by asking the Soya family members.　I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do it, but I'm sure I'll be able to do it.
Soya talks about the other side of the operation with pride.
On the other hand, Karasuma, who was probably used as bait without any prior explanation...
"……What?　What?
He looked down at the angry pedophiles rushing into the building and rolled his eyes.
"Why can't everyone see how wonderful little ham girls are!　Aren't all pedophiles one and the same!
Are we going to build a barricade or hide somewhere?
In a panic, he retreats behind the rooftop.
I'm sorry. Aoi-chan is safe, let's get rid of the pedophile slayer while we can!
You're a demon!
Well, I don't mind, because it's physi***** difficult to fight a long-term battle anyway, but before ……that.
"You, you're the one who's bringing out a dangerous man in a prison cell.
"I can't help it, it's an emergency!
He assured me in a tenth of a second.
You'……re going to be a good demon hunter.
I say this half sarcastically, half seriously.
They say that a good, honest girl can't handle an emergency.
I don't want to hear it from you, Mr. Furuya!
Soya, who had finished the first aid, said while even the expression of the shikigami blushed.
"No……? How many have you climaxed?
I'm sorry…….
I turn around to escape Soya's ****sing gaze.
We couldn't see everything because of the pedophiles and pedophile makers walking around, but even so, we couldn't count the number of people who had fallen between the station and here.
Hundreds of them.
"It was an ……emergency. I don't blame you.
You're right. 　But there's no way I could have gone this far and just failed to get rid of the spirit...
The shikigami controlled by Soya looks forward.
"Let's save Sakura-chan no matter what!
"……Oh.
I stand up and stare at it.
"Pedophile,…… pedophile, pedophile……, die!
The restraint technique slows down the movement of the pedophile slayer, and the three eight-headed shikigami toss her around, and a pleasure hole appears in her armor.
I put all the strength I had in my slightly recovered body and ran.
"Aaaaah!
"Lori……, con.
The pedophile slayer noticed us and swung her longsword around in the dark.
Doggoshaaaaaa!
……No!
This time he thrust his fingertips into the other thigh pad, ***rly blown away by the asphalt debris and the blast.
Vivekun!　Boom!
The thigh pad ***sts open, exposing the other side of Sakura's leg. But there is no pleasure ****ture there.
"Damn it, next!
"What?　Isn't that the end of the story after one poke? What?
"Because Sakura is protected by the armor, she can't see the pleasure pores of the main body!
What's wrong with that?　I'm not going to be able to do anything about it. What?
Apparently, he was planning to make the battle even shor*** than mine. Soya's Japanese had become strange in his panic.
"Just help me!　I can't reach the top!
"Oh, no……, I'll try!
I get a slight distance from the pedophile slayer and manage to avoid the attack and get behind him.
From there, he quickly reversed and ran to the back of the pedophile slayer.
"Come on!
Soya's shikigami was waiting for us.
He had his hands ***ded in a volleyball-receiving stance, and I jumped with my feet on them.
At the same time, the shikigami, though ineffectual, leaps up his arms as hard as he can.
"I did it!　It ***ked!
Nice work, Soya!
I jumped up to a height I would never have been able to reach alone, and as I ran up the pedophile slayer's back, I poked the floating pleasure apholes.
Beep, beep, beep!　Boom!
The armor on the back side bursts off, exposing Sakura's uniform from her back to her waist.
But still, there was no sign of the pleasu***** aphrodisiac hole.
Damn it!　But at this rate, sooner or later...
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
"What? What?
Once I was away from the pedophile slayer to lau*** my next attack, I had a bad feeling and moved further away.
The pedophile slayer barked lou*** and raised his longsword high in the air.
Immedi***** after the back-breaking pause - there was a huge explosion in the vici**** of the pedophile slayer.
"Whoa! What?
It was a non-standard sword strike that the pedophile slayer fired at his own feet.
The impact was so great that it seemed as if an unexp***** bomb buried in the ground had exploded.
I'm not sure what to say. '
"Oh, no! 　I worked so hard to recreate it. I'm sorry.
The three Soya Shikigami that had been clinging to the pedophile slayer were buried together.
Fuck you and…… your ……bullshit powers.
There was a cloud of dust around us, and visibility was terrible.
In the meantime.
I'll be back.
I heard the sound of footsteps shaking my armor.
"What the...?
Tëm, clang, clang.
It was definitely approaching me, but I couldn't see it from here.
"How the hell did you know where I was?
Are you on some kind of pedophile radar?
As I hurriedly began to leave the scene, out of the corner of my eye, I heard a boom.
The dust shook.
"Ugh! 
At about the same time as I quickly tightened my guards with my alienated hands, a huge sword blade appeared out of the dust - when my brain recognized this, I was already blown out of the dust.
"Aaaaaaahhhh! Aah!
The shock that came late spread evenly throughout my body.
But it doesn't end there.
"What the hell? 　What the hell? What the...?
I ran into a crowd of pedophiles and rolled around on the ground with several people, completely knocked out.
"…………Shit…….
Is it the blood flowing from my body? Is it the blood from my body, or is it the bodily fluids of the victims of the climax expulsion that I've put underneath me? A warm feeling see*** into my back, and the strength drained from my entire body.
Mr. Furuya!　Are you okay? 　Oh, my God!　The pedophile slayer is starting to target other people!
Soya's scream could be heard.
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
He must have switched his strategy after Soya's shikigami and I were killed. The sound of the "Bomb Breaker" attack shook the air. I'm sure it won't even buy you any time.
I have to go to Sakura, because I have the power to remove the spirits for sure...
But no matter how hard I gritted my teeth, I could bar*** stand up, let alone crawl on the ground.
That's when it happened.
"……?
Whiz, whiz, whiz.
There was a puddle of water from the tide that had been ***wed by the college girl lying nearby.
My face is reflected in that lewd mirr**** surface, and the center of my forehead is *****ering with light.
It is a pleasure aperture. It is also known as the pleasure point. It was an abominable pressure point that, if you poked it, you would immediately climax.
A *****urable aphrodisiac on my own body……?　When I ****owed my brow.
Do you want power?
"……What?
That dependable voice that I always hear when I'm in a pinch.
But for once, I had a bad feeling about this.
　　　　　6
If you want power, poke that pleasure pore.
No, no, no.
He had to stop himself aloud.
Because you know, "that" pleasurable aphrodisiac is the one glowing on my forehead, right?
I'm sorry…….
I glanced at the college girl in front of me.
"Aah……" "Hee!" "Ooh……!
The woman who had just attacked me with all her might and vigor***** played with a little girl is now lying face down with her eyes white and her fleshy body quivering with fluid dripping from everywhere.
The climax had taken all of her strength and she was unable to stand.
This is what you get when you go from full of energy to climax expulsion with one thrust.
I was about to die, but if I poked myself, wouldn't that cause a techno-break?　This was a very natural suspicion that crossed my mind.
I mean, poking your own pleasurable aphrodisiac hole, that's masturbation, right?
Masturbating when you're being hunted down by a vicious monster isn't crazy or anything like that. It's a kind of ****rium.
You want to help your sister, don't you?
How can ******bating to death in front of the enemy lead to saving the cherry blossoms?
But the voice that echoed in my head was filled with the conviction that I could save Sakura by poking her…….
I've come this far because I'm willing to do whatever it takes to save Sakura.
Make hund**** of them climax.
He smeared his hands with the returning tide.
So why should I hesitate to masturbate to death in front of the enemy?
If there was even the sligh**** chance that I could save Sakura, even if it was the devil's sweet talk, I would.
"Let's ……fuck and fuck.
Yeah. Yes, that's it.
While the voice in my head exuded a somewhat elated and happy emotion, I was.
The only people who can poke you are those who are ready to be poked.
As if carried away by the sweet words, I used the last of my strength to poke my own pleasure aphrodisiac hole.
Moment.
"─────────────.
My vision and consciousness were engulfed by the white light.
Like a broken machine, the *****rical signals of pleasure were explo**** like bees in his brain.
The electrical signals do not stop in the brain, but are transmitted to every muscle in the body, causing the entire body to twitch relentlessly without any room for my will to intervene.
"Aaaaahhhh!
A sham**** voice that I have never heard before leaks out of my mouth, and an embarrassing amount of fluid that I have never experienced before leaks from my lower body. It was sprin**** all over me. It was unstoppable.
It was a climax experience as if every single cell in my body was ejaculating.
In the pure white light, I couldn't make out anything.
Oh, my God!　Yummy ♥♥♥!
Was it my embarrassed voice, or someone else's charming voice?
This taste, quantity, quality……. Gokun. I knew I made the right choice in choosing you, Furuya…….
The sweet, loving whispers of suspicion melted into the light - and event***** my consciousness was pulled back to reality.
Just…… hurry up, please. I don't think you'll be able to keep it up for very long.
"……Huh.
The first thing that surprised me was that my mind was so clear that it reminded me of the blue skies and meadows of summer.
Even though the inside of my pants was a mess beyond description, it didn't bother me too much.
My mind, free of distractions, was able to *****ately assess the situation around me and naturally understand what I should do next.
He stood up and took a step forward to get to the pedophile slayer.
Immediately, though, I bumped into a crowd of pedophiles crowding the road.
I'm sorry…….
I could barely make my way through the dense crowd.
It was as if I was strolling along a ****rted promenade, effortlessly.
He could read the movements of the pedophiles. I *****tively knew what they were going to do next, and my body was moving on its own, thinking that if I moved like this, I would be able to move forward. And above all.
(I feel light)
My body, which had been unable to even stand up earlier, was filled with a strange power.
It's not that my physical abilities have improved by any means.
Still, my body felt light on a level as if ***vity had suddenly been reduced, as if I had jumped out of the water into the air. It was as if my whole body had been boosted. Yes.
Pleasure point boost.
Was it the voice in my brain that told me, or was it my own idea?
Surrendering to the new power of climax expulsion following the inorganic climax, I ran to the pedophile slayer.
"Soya.
"What?　Huh? 　I'm not sure what to do, but I'm sure you'll be fine…….
When I arrived at the space where the dust still lingered, I called out to Soya's shikigami, who could only watch the situation from the sidelines.
In the event that you have any questions concerning where and how to use the internet, you can call us at the web site.
'Huh, Mr. Furuya?　Why do you have such a crisp expression on your face?　You look like you're peeing really hard.……
Soya covered his eyes with his hands and pointed to my pants, which had a huge stain on them. The crotch area.
"No problem. It's more than that now.
I brushed aside Soya's point and asked him to do one thing.
"I'm going to hit the pedophile slayer now. Be ready to ass*** me just in case.
"What? What?
At the same time, I ran into the pedophile slayer again.
I guess it was because he saw me. The bombs and demon cards stopped attacking.
"Pedophile. ……Kill…… him.
Sensing the presence of the pedophile, the pedophile slayer emerged through the smoke of spiritual power.
A flash of the longsword's sideways cleave sends me flying through the air in an attempt to cut my torso in half.
"……Oh, no.
I jumped to avoid it, and at the same time, I jumped again, using the belly of my longsword as a springboard.
Reaching out as if head-sliding in midair, she pokes the pedophile slayer's basket.
Beep, beep, beep!　Boom!
As soon as he twisted around and landed on the ground, the pedophile slayer's baskets burst open.
Then, as expected, the pedophile slayer drop*** her longsword, crea**** a huge gap.
……What? What?
The single red eye ***king out from his helmet ***ered as if in confusion.
He fleshed out the pedophile slayer, who had lost her weapon, and crawled up the side of her body.
Waistplate, right upper arm, right shoulder blade. The body is full of gaps, and I poke at them in succession.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa!
The pedophile slayer flailed as if chasing off a winged insect, and I jumped down to escape from its hands. The wind pressure shakes my hair in such a way that I can be sure that even a graze of my fingertips will be fatal, but it means nothing if I don't get hit.
Beep, beep, beep!　Boom!
The armor I thrust at him climaxes and bursts off, falling to the ground as he follows me on the landing.
"……Shit, next.
Sakura's exposed body was her right arm and both thighs. There are no pleasure apholes there either.
Oh, my God!　I don't need your support! 　What's going on? What's going on?
Soya lets out a voice over the shikigami that can't be taken as either cheer or confusion.
What do you mean?　It seems like Mr. Furuya is climaxing more often…….……
I'm not sure what you're gazing at with your demon eyes while you're exorcising.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa!
The pedophile slayer picked up his longsword again.
The pedophile slayer raises his sword, probably thinking that a ranged attack would be effective against me moving around quickly. He's going to cause the big explosion again. But that's not
Bad move.
I ran straight for the swinging longsword with all my might.
"When dealing with weapons, use half your body and keep it small. Don't be afraid to move forward.
While talking about the attitude that Sakura taught me, I drew my sword so hard that my bangs were cut off - and then I jumped.
Doggoshaaaaaaaa!
My feet exploded under me, but the momentum sent me flying forward.
He ran up the arms of the pedophile slayer and jumped into her pocket.
How's that?
He thrusts the left upper arm and shoulder armor, then the helmet, then the breastplate as he ***ses through the gap between the arms.
Beep, beep, beep!　Boom!
Finally, the pedophile slayer loses…… most of her front armor.
I finally found it.
A spiritual substance reminiscent of black sludge. The navel of Sakura, who is limp and trapped there as if at the stake, is glowing with light.
It's Sakura's own pleasurable ***nic hole.
Now all we have to do is poke it.
I can help Sakura.
As I distanced myself from the pedophile slayer, I put all my strength into my legs to ***nch one last attack.
Tëm.
　　　　　7
I guess the world doesn't work that way.
"……Oh? Oh!
The moment came all too suddenly.
My knee was broken, and my whole body was filled with intense pain and a tremendous sense of fatigue.
My brain, which had been so clear, regained its normal ****ness as if it were hazy, and I even started to feel sleepy.
Oh,…… my God.
One more blow. It's only one shot.
The effect of the pleasure point boost had worn off, and I couldn't move an inch from my spot.
I'll be back.
As opposed to.
Tëm, clang, clang.
Dark**** as unfathomable as the night sea.
A pedophile slayer with a huge longsword, ***ing a body composed of a spiritual substance that can only be ****ribed as such, comes at me with ease.
No damage at all. Of course, I was just strip**** off the armor, not doing anything to damage it.
Thud, thud, thud!　Thud!　Thud, thud, thud!
The professional's attack was resumed from a distance with ****llent judgment, but perhaps the level of the attack was different regardless of the presence or absence of armor. The Lolicon Slayer, a monster with a spirit level of 5, was not intimidated by the explosion and was closing in on us.
"Damn, one more boost and I'm ……done.
I wondered if my body would be able to withstand two consecutive climax expulsions.
There is no guarantee. But if we don't do something, we'll surely be killed, and more importantly, we won't be able to save Sakura.
I crawled my eyes all over my body in desperation.
But no matter how hard I looked, I couldn't find the pleasure pore on my body.
"Pedophile. ……Kill…….
The pedophile slayer was close at hand, twisting around to protect Sakura from the flames of the explosion.
(Should I ask Soya's shikigami to lend me a shoulder and go for it with all my might? 　No matter how slow the pedophile slayer is, she's not that naive…….
Assuming that my body would not move, I thought of a strategy with a hazy mind.
But there was no way I could come up with a strange idea in such a situation, and I was devastated.
"……Ugh, I have no choice but to bet on this!　Furuya-kun!　Sakura-chan!　I'm sorry, both of you!
The beautiful eight-headed goddess that Soya controls came up next to me.
"It's an emergency!　So yes, this is not an option!
I put my hand on my pants, screaming as an excuse.
"……What?
Kacha-kacha.
The eight-headed beauty manipu***** her white fingertips with an unfamiliar hand and unbuckled my belt.
"What?
Gigi was confused, not understanding the situation.
The shikigami Soya was ****pping his zipper with trembling hands…….
What the hell are you doing in this situation? What are you doing?
I panicked and resisted when I realized that Soya was trying to rip my pants off.
"I don't need to be told by you, Furuya, who masturbates…… and plays with herself while she's being exorcised.
Oh, they know!　 ……No, that's not an option anymore!
"What the hell are you doing ripping my pants off? What are you doing?
No!　I don't want pants, I want pants!
"Don't be stupid, asshole!
I've made ****reds of people climax, masturbated to death in front of the enemy during the exorcism, and now I'm supposed to get my lower half all over the place? 　How many times do I have to die before I'm socially acceptable?　You're like a cat that's died a million times!
'Just take it off!　I'm embarrassed too!
"If you're embarrassed, don't...
Swoop!
*****tance with a body that can't move well is not even enough to buy time.
I was stripped of my pants and ***rts with ease.
It was chilly with my messy lower body touching the outside air.
Oh, no!　Oh no!　It's so heavy!　The area between my legs is very heavy!
Soya's shikigami pinched my pants with his fingertips and ***med them into the pedophile slayer while making strange noises. What kind of idiot is that?……
I was cowering, covering my lower half with my hands.
If it's Sakura-chan's one and only absolute wanker, I hope it can distract her in some way!
Soya continued to shout something unintel******* and threw my pants at me.
The mysterious liquid that had increased its weight significantly did not slow down on the way, but headed straight for the pedophile slayer. To be precise, to Sakura's face.
I'm done!
With the worst sound ever, Sakura's limp face was covered with my pants.
The pants were stuck to Sakura's face with a mysterious adhesive force.
What did that idiot…… think he was doing ***ting…… my pants on the cherry tree?
It was such a terrible turn of events that I almost lost my train of thought.
"……Huh…………?
"What?
Sakura's head, trapped in the center of the pedophile slayer, shook faintly.
And then I thought I saw the faintest movement of a cherry nose covered in pants.
"……Hey, big guy……?
Why not?
How did you know those soggy pants were mine?
What do you think I am, Sakura?
As I freeze there in shock, something even more unbelievable happens.
……………………What? What?
The pedophile slayer, a conglomerate of negative emotions, slo*** down as if confused by something, and dropped his longsword.
As usual, the bomb/breaker tag does not seem to be an effective tool.
However, like a malfunctioning machine, his movements became jerky.
"You did it!　That's more than I could have imagined!
I can't explain it. I can't explain it.
"Mr. Furuya!　Now!
"Oh!
This is our last chance.
I'm not sure what to do, but I'm sure I'll be able to do it.
With the support of my shoulders, I run with Soya's shikigami.
The bottom half of her body was exposed.
……By the way, Mr. Furuya...
Soya suddenly muttered to himself.
"When this case is successfully solved, let's go buy a safe to manage our laundry.……
What's a safe for managing laundry?
However, now was not the time to be dealing with Soya's delusions.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
"……Yes!
Perhaps noticing our approaching presence, the pedophile slayer slapped his hands together. But his movements were slow. Too slow!
Go, go, go!　Furuya-kun!
"Aaaaah!
As if pushed by a shikigami, I accelerated and kicked the ground with the last of my strength.
It's over!
I poked with all my might at the pleasure flirt hole glowing in Sakura's navel.
"Huh? Aah!
I'll be back.
He said I would crumble at the feet of the pedophile slayer.
The cherry blossoms above my head trembled and a faint voice ***aped me.
The fleshy body began to shake and tremble.
"What,……what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what?
Giggle, giggle, giggle!
Sakura's crucified body. The large, well-developed hips are swaying as if to entice the man, dancing lewdly.
"Oh, my God,……I'm getting something. ♥?
Her breasts had grown to the point where they could be seen even from the top of her uniform. The tips of her breasts had grown so large that they rubbed against each other with each twitch, causing Sakura's body to shake with even greater convulsions.
What the fuck is this……? 　 "……Don……'t let your head fall off, you dirty ……head…………!" "Oh,……oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
She let out a hot voice with her lisp*** tongue, her eyes looking in the direction of the day after tomorrow as she shivered with pleasure.
In the event that you have any questions regarding where and the best way to get in touch with us, please do not hesitate to contact us.
No, no, no, no, no, no! 　No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Jump! Jump!　Jump!
Whoo-whoo!　Whoo-hoo!　Splash, splash, splash!
The pink tongue sti*** out of Sakura's mouth like an erection, drooling visco**** and quivering.
As her hips spasmed and bounced, a hot stream of liquid, even steamy, shot out from between Sakura's legs!　A hot liquid, even steamy, spur*** from between Sakura's legs, pouring all over my body.　I'm not sure what to do, but I'm going to do it.
"……Huh, ……huh, huh, huh, h…………huh.
Just when Sakura had reached her climax, she let out a hot breath and shivered slightly in the aftermath of her pleasure.
Huh.
The pedophile slayer fizzled into thin air, and the trapped Sakura fell.
Watch out!　Watch out!
It's a good idea to use your last ounce of strength to catch it, but you'll fall to the ground as if you were being pushed down by the rising body temperature of the cherry blossoms.
Thank God!　Sakura, are you inju*** or in any other way sick...
I was at a loss for words when I tried to ask that question.
"……Huh. Mmm.
"……Oh, no.
The hot breath of the burning cherry blossoms seeped into my neck.
The soft twin ***nds pressed against each other and the tips of the mou*** grazed my breastplate. ****ever Sakura's hips bounced up and down, she would say, "Ouch!　I'm sure you'll be able to understand why.
Fully finished, Sakura's *****tuous body was hot, sloppy flesh itself, and her whole body even exuded a thick pheromone.
Even I, who usually have little sexual desire, and who had just climaxed a few moments ago with a pleasure point boost, was str*** by her sex appeal...
No, no, no, no, no!　What am I doing…… with my sister?
I was in a state of self-doubt, when I suddenly realized.
I'm nervous about a non-lolita Sakura……?
As my exhausted body slowly looked around, the whole area was completely silent.
The people who had been ***ling around in search of lolita have folded up and fainted, and the little girls wandering around trying to turn people into pedophiles have disappeared.
This way, Karasuma would be safe.
"……Hmm. Well, at any rate, the Harugahara fiasco is now over.
When I felt relieved.
"…………Hey, big guy……?
Sakura, who was half unconscious from the intense pleasure, opened her mouth faintly with fuzzy eyes.
"You're all right, Sakura. But you still need to rest...
Hey, big guy…….
"What? What?
Sakura, who probably hadn't fully regained consciousness yet, hugged me tigh*** in a lisping tone.
In a lot of ways, it's just too much.
"You ……saved me, ……I was scared, I was ……so scared, ……but you saved me, just like the ……old days, even though…… I was like ……this, you saved me,…… you saved me, you saved me.……
"Well, Kura, it's just, um...
"Even with all these crazy abilities, you're still a ……big guy.……
Would you say ……so?
I've made hund**** of people climax, I've masturbated in front of the enemy, and I've poked your navel with my bare bottom.
But there was no response to that.
Sakura repe**** her delirium like a child and then passed out as if she were soooooo sleepy.
His face was so calm and peaceful.
The two hands that were ****ezing my shirt looked so small that I couldn't help but shake them off.
Hey, hey.
"What? What?
The cold voice that suddenly poured down on me scared the hell out of me, even though I had nothing to be ashamed of.
The owner of the voice is Misaki Soya herself.
On the occasion of the *****etion of the exorcism, he was breathing heavily, as if he had been running as fast as he could up to this point.
But his eyes were cold and filled with a terrible light that reminded me of maple.
Why don't you at least put some pants on for now?
You're the one who took my pants off!
I protested to Soya and then tried to find my pants, but I couldn't move a single ……fingertip. I was crushed by Sakura's ripe body, and my consciousness was fading.
Then Soya's lips pursed in a sul*** manner.
"Oh, no. I think I'll report it to the Audit Department. I'm going to tell the audit department that Furuya-kun was embracing the person he had expelled from his climax in the nude.
"You.……
When he had no energy left to fight back and did as he was told, Soya's voice leaked out in relief while his expression remained grim.
"But that's good. I guess we're done with the pedophile slayer for now.
……No, not yet.
What?
Indeed, the exorcism of the pedophile slayer was complete and Sakura could be saved.
The matter is now settled.
***ept for one thing: that demon tribe that ****acted us through Sakura's body.
What……? 　Furuya-kun, Furuya-kun!　Whoa!　Someone!　Does anyone have a first aid charm?
Soya asked for an explanation, but ……apparently his body was seriously damaged.
My consciousness was cut off as if I were turning off a power switch.
●
"Hmm, so that's what our king has become.
A group of skyscr***** in a plot a short distance from Harugahara.
A high school girl was sitting on the edge of the roof of one of the tall*** buildings in the city.
She smiled happily as she pecked at her own cheek, which was painted with a heart.
"I see, indeed, why that little boy would want to bet on the future of the demon race. I see.
She had been looking in Harugahara's direction, but she shook her shoulders and looked back.
There were several skilled people approaching us at a high rate of speed.
"The association is pretty good these days. Hey, Human No. 3. Come here.
Ha!
A middle-aged man emerged from the darkness.
He was a man who appeared as a ***dit on a wide range of shows and one-sidedly disparaged the Demonologist Association.
It looks like two half-assed decoys weren't enough to dodge the Society's pursuit. Please take care of the third decoy.
"Very well, sir. Master Andromalius.
When she held out her hand, a blackened miasma enveloped the middle-aged man, and conversely, any sign of humanity disappeared from her. Her appearance is completely "just an unusually cute high school girl.
Well, now that I'm *****ested in the parts, I think I'll do something devious for a change.
She - Andromarius - smiled a big smile as she retre**** from the rooftop by walking down the stairs like a human.
Righteous deviousness.
epilogue
It had been four days since I had defeated the pedophile slayer before I regained consciousness.
And after I woke up, I couldn't even get up from the hospital bed for a while because of the pain all over my body.
According to the doctor's explanation, every muscle in my body was in muscle pain, on the verge of separation. He was so exhausted that he was on the verge of dying of exhaustion, and his ability to recover was so low that there was nothing he could do except to take an intravenous drip and rest. On top of that, for some reason, he had become so weak that he seemed to have run out of energy, and it was no joke that he was at HP1.
It wasn't like he was badly injured or anything, but he had wounds all over his body.
Last time, I was able to recover quickly thanks to Soya's call for a skilled healer, but this time, well, things happened and there was no special treat****.
The reason for this is that thanks to Soya's actions, such as *****oying the association's headquarters and taking out the pedophile Karasuma, the Soya family was unable to talk to him.
But I was convinced ……that the main reason was my own.
……I'm fucked.
It was about a week from the time he regained consciousness until he was discharged from the hospital.
I couldn't move properly, and as I lay on the bed, I felt a fierce sense of regret.
How many civilians have ……I made climax……?
The more I thought about it calmly, the more strange sweat broke out all over my body.
There was no other way to save Sakura.
No matter how many times I repeated the same scene, I would definitely make the same choice.
However, that didn't mean I had the mental strength to regain my composure.
I'm not sure what to make of this, but I think it's a good idea.
I……'m not ……sure…… what to do, but I'm sure you'll be able to figure it out.
"They're adding some more abilities that I don't understand, and…… what's with the…… pleasure point boost?……
If you pick up your phone, you'll get a text message from the ****oles in D class, just like sometime ago.
You've been jerking off while fighting a monster this time,…… and I respect you for it.
I'm not ……sure what to make of this.
Once again, it seemed that half-baked and distorted information was being passed around the school.
When I saw the messages from the boys, which could be described as both disgusting and awe-inspiring, I got a headache.
"Just when I'd managed to get through the decapitation trial, with so much being said about the pedophile slayer, what have I done?……
There is no such thing as a fast treatment…… as a reward for kill*** a ghost with a spirit level of 5.
Rather, I was trembling in bed for a while, thinking that the not guilty verdict (*****sional) in the decapitation trial could be overturned at the earliest opportunity…….
For some reason, there was no blame to be pla*** on me for any length of time, and I was to be discharged from the hospital today without incident.
I don't know what……'s going on.
(I threw away the D●M gift certif***** and masturbator set that Karasuma gave me right there.
"No matter how much trouble Harugahara's case didn't cause, the fact that we haven't heard anything from the Audit Department...……
The commotion in Harugahara was barely reported.
In addition to the fact that most of the people who were there had fuzzy ****ries due to the effects of pedophilia, the media, which had been ****uing the association for the pedophile slayer, suddenly toned down for some reason. I wondered if the insider who was leaking the information that fueled the media's ****rage had been caught, but I didn't hear anything about that either…….
I wondered if Kaede's grandmother had done something to her, but that didn't feel right either.
In any case, it made me feel uncomfortable to know that the Audit Department, which had been pursuing me so much, had not heard anything from me and was ***ping my treatment in the dark.
Speaking of being vague.
Kaede, what are you going to do for your next checkup……?
Kaede said that after the pedophile slayer thing is taken care of, we might be able to talk about my curse.
However, no matter how many times I contacted him, he just said "I'm busy right now" and rejected me out of hand, and I haven't seen him in a while.
There were signs that he sneaked in for a routine checkup once while I was unconscious…….
I know you're busy, but...
Emergence of the demon race.
In the end, it seems that the anti-demons team that the association organized on an emergency basis was unable to reach the main circle.
The only harv*** was three humans who had been bewitched by the demon race.
Kaede, as a member of the old family, and more importantly as the one who had directly seen the miasma of the demon tribe, seemed to be busy trac**** it down.
In the event that you're not sure what you're ……looking for, it's understandable that you'll want to prioritize it over anything else.
I don't know.
Well, Kaede has never missed a regular checkup, and I'm sure we'll have a chance to talk soon.
(……Come to think of it, not only Kaede but also Mei didn't show up at the hospital this time.
Feeling a little sad, I left the hospital and boar*** the train to Demon Academy.
As I *****ndered my body to the regular swaying, my foggy mind thought about the cherry blossoms.
That's what's the most difficult part of this whole thing, isn……'t it?
Actually, Kaede called me once while I was in the hospital, one-sidedly. It was right after I woke up.
'Since you're not going to be able to treat me for screaming at you to tell me more about the little girl's safety, I'll just tell you the conclusion briefly. I don't have time for this, so please be quiet and listen.
I heard Kaede's disgusted voice as Soya's hand held the phone to my ear.
After counseling, I found that she did not have the kind of mind that could create a pedophile slayer. If I had to say, I would ……say that her avoid**** of being treated like a child was distorted into the elimination of pedophiles, but at least it wasn't a desire so distorted that it developed into a monster, and she discip***** herself well.
So why, I asked, urg*** him to go on, when to be honest I was having a hard time even speaking.
"I was forced to become a monster. It's more likely that he was implanted with a monster. It's a reasonable conclusion, consid***** the calculated nature of the monster. ……I'm sure you'll be able to figure out the best way to get the most out of this.
Judging from the flow of the story, it was definitely the demon tribe that had sprinkled the miasma.
I was getting more and more worried about Sakura's safety, wondering if she had been spotted by such a person, but Kaede, who seemed to have sensed this, unusually ****ened her voice and said
"Don't worry. Someone's vulgar exorcism has worked perfectly, and there are no after-effects of the monstrosity or the miasma. ……My future as an auditor is still undecided, but I'm sure Nagisa-san's apprentice won't turn out badly. Unfortunately.
While I was relieved to hear Kaede's report with her hateful comment about Sakura at the end, a new concern arose in my mind.
At this timing, right after the curse of this climax expulsion was exposed to the people around me.
Isn't it too much of a stretch to think that Sakura, who was chosen to watch over me, would be spotted by the demons?
"You're ……thinking too much.
But when I asked her about it, Kaede just assured me that she did.
I'm sure you'll be fine. You've been a little too reckless with people, just like with Shinonome City's monster A. I don't care if that's your job as a demonologist.
He hung up the phone in a hurry, leaving a firm comment.
Kaede said that, but is it really just a coincidence?……
But like any other pending issue, it is not something that can be concluded by thinking about it.
I was convinced that it was okay as long as Sakura was safe, and that was when I got off at the ***rest station to the Demon Academy.
"Oh, hello, Mr. Furuya?
Soya's call came in with seemi**** perfect timing.
For some reason, he seemed to be in a very bad mood right after the defeat of the pedophile slayer, but now his voice is as cheerful as if he were talking on the phone.
It's been a few days since the warning to our team to revoke our provisional license was completely withdrawn due to the fact that we got rid of a ghost with a spirit level of 5. Soya has been like this for a long time.
"I thought you were getting out of the hospital today, right?
Yeah, I just got to the station.
It was just the thing!　Would you like to go shopping to celeb**** your recovery and to *****morate *****aining your provisional license?
Are you going out for a ……cake?
No, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Furuya-kun's room blew up the other day, didn't it?　That's why I thought I'd have to get furniture and dis*** again.
"Ah!
That's right. I completely forgot about it.
When I ***aped from the auditor, my room was wrecked by the explosion of the physical ward.
I was informed that the room itself had been fixed by the Demon Academy, but the personal belongings inside were still in shambles.
If I go home like this, there will be nothing but torn up bedding and shattered dishes.
"Right?　I'll pick out a new one for you, so let's go today.
I think ……so.
I was a little surprised to hear Soya say something like this, but I nee*** to do some shopping anyway, so I agreed. It……'s a good thing I'm not a pedophile slayer.
"Then we'll meet in front of the school gate later!
I went back to my room to check what ***ded to be renewed, and then decided to meet up with Soya.
I ran a bit to the dormitory to rehabilitate my body, which was worn out from living in the hospital.
When I reached the door of my room, which was in good repair, I suddenly looked at the next room, 407.
Well, what's going to happen to ……this room?
According to Kaede, it remained to be seen what would become of Sakura's position as an auditor.
That means I don't even know what my job as a watcher will be.
Could it be that they are going to move out of the city?
It was a hec*** time, and Sakura's ****tant pouting almost broke my heart, but the thought of being separated from her ……again made me sad.
With this thought in mind, I put my hand on the door**** of my room.
"What?
Is the door unlocked?
Did the *****actor who repaired my room forget to lock the door?　So I opened the door - the first thing that struck me as strange was the good smell that tickled my nostrils.
The next thing that caught my eye was
"Welcome ……home.
A lonely room in a DK room. There was a girl standing in the kitchen.
Her cheeks were slightly dyed, and she was glar*** at me with a scowl.
Don't just stand ……there, get your ass in here, you piece of shit.
It was Sakura in her apron.
●
Come on, sit down.
"Huh?　Huh?　Huh?
A complete surprise.
Why are you here?　Before I could even ask the question, he roughly pulled my hand and sat me down at the dining room table.
I looked around the room in confusion and saw that it was complete, just as I *****bered it, with bedding, tables, desks, schoolbooks, notebooks, stationery and other small items.
For a moment I wondered if I had dreamt the room exploding, but every item was clearly new. All of the items I had been using had been ****aced in their entirety.
"……I ****acked your room before, remember?　I bou*** all the stuff I remem***** from that time. The audit department pays well.
What Sakura brought to the table was a cera*** plate with the same pattern as the one I used to use sometimes.
Served on the table was a home**** croquette.
There was even a bowl of pork miso soup next to it, full of ingredients.
You loved it. You loved it.
Sakura said, looking in the direction of the day after tomorrow.
"Oh, oh.
This probably means that I should eat.
I half-heartedly took a bite of the meal that was served to me.
The first bite was fearful, but the second bite was half-hearted.
……Yum!　You're getting really good at cooking, aren't you? Yeah.
Even though I had only eaten veget***** hospital food for a while, Sakura's food was exceptionally delicious. It was also my favorite food, so my chopsticks kept moving.
Right?
Then my eyes suddenly met Sakura's with a big smile on her face.
Sakura smiled half smugly, half with a heart**** "I did it! Sakura was smiling half smugly, half heartily happy, and her chopsticks stopped for a moment.
"……Oh, no.
Then Sakura immediately made a blunt expression, while still slightly raising the edge of her mouth.
It's not that I'm amazing, it's that you're crappy!　The last time I ransacked your room, it was so bad I was shocked!
Sakura turned her head away and continued like a machine gun.
The house is not ***aned well, there is too much garbage and laundry piled up, and the refrig****** is not properly stocked, so it's obvious that she doesn't cook for herself. You're not living alone at all. Instead of worr**** about me, you should take care of yourself first.
I'm ……sorry.
So I'll take care of him for a while.
What?
"Oh, don't get me wrong!
I was so confused that Sakura slammed the table in my face.　and slammed the table.
And contrary to his fierce expression, his face turned red, and in a muffled voice
"……You saved me. You saved me.
"……Uh, yeah, ……well, yeah.
I squirm when I'm told.
I can't help but be reminded of Sakura's body, which is now in a state of restlessness.
I don't have such feel**** for my sister, but the situation of being alone with her in my room makes me feel awkward on my own.
I really can't believe it.
Despite me, Sakura squeezes out her voice.
It was just after he was acquitted in the decapitation trial, but he used his ability against hundreds of people and went berserk. He's a pervert. He's the scum of demons. ……I told you that I don't want to be protected or saved by you.
Sakura glared at me accusingly, but then stopped cursing and brought me something from the refrigerator.
To my surprise, it was homemade pudding. They had even prepared a dess*** for us.
So I'm just paying you back.
Sakura said as she gingerly pushed the spoon at me.
So don't make the mistake of thinking that you need to be taken care of by me, okay? So don't get the wrong idea.
"……I see. I get it.
Hearing Sakura's argument, I agreed and took a bite of the pudding. ……Wow, this is delicious too.
In short, this is Sakura's way of saying thank you.
Of course, some people can't stand to be helped one way or the other, but I guess that's the way it is. They even went to the trouble of buying back the furniture. ……It's a little scary that it's an exact match to what I was using before.
You don't care?
I asked Sakura after I had finished my meal.
"I don't know if you're going to continue to monitor me or if you're going to go back to the audit department, but you have a job to do, don't you?
When I say this out of concern for Sakura, who's even just a little bit sick.
I've been asked, quite reluctantly, to continue as your monitor.
"Oh, really?
And for some reason, your guard level has been lowered by one, so your *****vision is more relaxed than before. I have a lot of free time at school compared to Master's training, and I'm dying of ***edom if I don't take care of you. ……Or what?　Are you unhappy that I'm taking care of you?
Sakura's eyes narrowed.
After what you did to ……me.
Yeah.
I was at a loss for words when I suddenly saw Sakura's voice tremble and her thighs squirm.
Then, perhaps sens*** my agitation, Sakura's face turned bright red.
"So take the blame and let me take care of you!　You should be ****king me!　 ……Big brother.
……What?　You're here.
That's it!　I was about to chase after Sakura as she ran away to clean up the dishes when I saw her.
Bang!
"Whoa! What?
I heard something hit the window and looked over to see a two-headed girl sticking to it.
I've seen it before. It's ……Soya's shikigami!
Oh!　I looked at the clock on the desk and saw that it was long past the appointed time for the meeting.
"Hey, Mr. Furuya!　What are you and Sakura doing as newlyweds? 　I mean, the furniture!　It's all here!　What's going on? What's going on?
Oh no!　Sakura's appearance was so shocking that I completely forgot about her!
I don't know... but Soya's contacted me…… on his cell phone before he flew the shikigami.
No matter how many times I rummaged through my pockets, I couldn't find my phone, and just as I was getting impatient to see if I'd dropped it somewhere...
"Damn. I didn't know you were meeting up beforehand. My alone time with you was interrupted…….
Sakura came back after hearing the commotion and handed me her phone, "Yes," she said.
"I just found it on the front porch. You're really out of it.
What?　Oh, yeah. Thank you?
Sakura told me to take it. ……Why isn't it on?　Did I bump into something weird when I dropped it?　 ……I guess I shouldn't think about it too much.
"Hey, Sakura-chan!　It's not healthy for the two of you to be alone in a room, no matter how much you're the watcher!　I'm sure you're not the only one who's had a bad experience. I'm sorry.
The shikigami that Soya was controlling burst into flames!
"……You're so annoying. You've been trying to erode my brother's life by buying new furniture and dishes without permission.
"Hey, Sakura……?
He didn't say a word to Soya, but he did not hesitate to call out to Sakura, who erased the shikigami without question.
Is that a new kind of curse you've been muttering about?
I've already prepared a bath for you, but I think you should go in now.　You don't plan to go out anymore anyway, do you?
Well, it seems like my plans to go out have just disappeared.…… I was about to be swept away by the mysterious pressure emanating from the cherry blossoms, when
"Hey!　It's a foul thing to suddenly attack a shikigami!　You can't do that!
BANG BANG BANG!
The sound of Soya's ramp*** could be heard from the front door, which had been locked for some time.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Soya!　This is a boys' dormitory. Soya!
So? 　Sakura-chan lives next door to you!
If you say so, I can't argue with you, but…… Soya, stop that banging on the door!　You're annoying the neighbors!
"Come on, big brother. I'll do the dishes, so go take a bath.
How are you able to treat Soya as if he's not even here……?
He said I was shivering.
A powered-up phone continuously ale*** you to incoming emails.
"Hey, Haruhisa. That's enough!
"You're locking me out, Misaki-chan, do you have a penis?　Are you seriously a pedophile?
"……I'm going to fuck you. You public masturbator.
While enjoying a holiday in the dormitory, the boys receive a death threat!
I want to go back to the ……hospital.
Every day as a demonologist, there is no time to relax during work and everyday life.
There are a lot of things that are ***cky about the pedophile slayer and the curse of climax expulsion.
But well.
"How long do you think you can keep making noise on my doorstep, you stupid bitch? 　I'm going to salt you as hard as I can!
Seeing her cute little sister doing well, she was satis**** for the moment.
postscript
Parent: "I read the climax expulsion!
I said……, "What? Are you hallucinating?
Parents: "You're so much easier to read than Shimoseka!
I said……, "Oh……, this isn……'t an auditory hallucination.
Parent: "That was more normal than I expected!
I said……, "Oh, ……yes……. (What is normal?)
 ……I'm not sure.
It is said that writ*** are supposed to push their main *****cters to the bottom of misery, but somehow I am facing a reality that makes me sweat much more strangely than Haruhisa. I wonder what it is. Is it the return of a curse?
Now, let's start over.
The second vol*** of this series has already begun to show the infla**** of the whee**** voice (what is the inflation of the wheezing voice?). How is everyone doing?
As for me, the cover of this volume is so erotic and cute that I feel like I'm going to explode. What's with that expression? Is she asking me out? What's with the firm lower half of her body? Is she asking me out? Your ***ves and thighs are coming together to create a second cleavage, aren't they? You can't help but want to crawl your fingers into that cleavage. Sakura is a bad girl. That's why she gets into trouble in the story, you know?　Please reflect on that (shifting the blame).
I really want to make this story more beautiful, but I can……'t stop myself from creating more and more horrible scenes just to see Mataro's illustrations. I can't let the image of a pure ***ter that I've built up at Nidnuts be ……swept away!　No matter how attractive Mr. Mataro's illustrations are, if I keep my mind strong, I'll have……?……
I've been resisting desperately as a pure ****cess knight ***ter of the proud ***gdom of Gagaggia for a while now, but somehow I've managed to deliver the second volume safely.
After the first volume was released, I was a little surprised at the unexpectedly large number of positive reviews I received while ego-surfing. I'm wondering if it's okay for me to be more open-minded after the second volume. What did you think of the second volume? I don't know what's normal and what's not normal anymore, but for now, as long as the girls are climaxing, there's no problem!　It's not an ******ration to say that this series is for that purpose only. The CG books you buy from D*M are for refer**** only, they are for your work.
I'd like to thank all the people who were involved in this work, which is a work of self-satisfaction for the lower half of my body. I would like to express my gratitude for all the help you have given me since the first volume. I don't know when this work will be caught by the publi***** code and disappear, but I would appreciate it if you could continue to lend me your support.
I'll see you all again in the next volume, even though the regulations are getting stricter these days.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! (Farewell speech) (Gorilla?)
Epilogue II
"……Huh.
The headquarters of the Association of Demonologists. In the corner of a quiet hallway. An inorganic resting bench next to a vend*** machine.
It had been more than ten days since the pedophile slayer had been defeated.
The search for the demon tribe had hit a snag, and Kaede, who had unwantedly found herself with some time on her hands, was resting for the first time in a long time.
"Hey, Kuzunoha.
Suddenly, a translucent woman appeared from the wall and called out to Kaede from above her head, where she was slurping down a can of coffee.
Are you ……Nagisa?
Kaede, unfazed, turns her slightly fati**** eyes to Nagisa.
Nagisa the Technique Crusher.
He is a former Twelve Master Ten and the current head of the Audit Department.
Having put Furuya Haruhisa's decapitation trial on hold at her discretion, she glared at Kaede with the eyes of a dead fish and continued in a low voice.
"It's time for you to speak. What the hell is that thing?
I think that's ……pretty much what you're expecting.
I don't even need to check what that thing is.
Haruhisa Furuya. It is the curse that resides in his hands.
Kaede left the view to the other person so that Nagisa would not inadvertently divulge more information than she had. Nagisa's eyes narrowed sullenly.
It's not like you're trying to fool us. It is the official opinion of the Audit Department that you Kuzunoha have been concealing the existence of the "unknown sexual relic". It's also a common perception of the old family and the upper echelons of the association.
My psychic vision has an unbelievable credibility," Nagisa said as she searched for Kaede's reaction.
Emphasize "unknown sexual relic.
"I can't believe it……, but I'm pretty sure it's the ninth relic," he said. But that makes it even more confusing.
Nagisa rubbed her head as a spirit, and listed her views as if she were questioning Kaede.
The discovery of new sexual artifacts has not been documented for hundreds of years. As far as I know, there are no records of such ridiculous abilities as climax expulsion. So those two hands just appeared out of nowhere.
Nagisa continued, interjecting, "It's creepy.
I'm not sure what to do. If Sakura's report that she started wearing the bracelet as a temporary seal when she was in sixth grade is correct, then the sex relic has been haun**** Haruhisa Furuya for more than four years.
……Yes, I will.
When Kaede ***nkly admitted that she had no idea what she was doing, Nagisa immediately replied, "No way.
But it was not a denial, it was more like a marvel of incredulity.
"If that's true, then that kid has been friends with that curse for more than twice as long as Soya's heiress.
It's true.
I'm not sure what…… to do. I'm sure you've got a lot of questions.
That's what I was hoping to hear.
Kaede looked back at Nagisa, unconsciously putting more strength into her hands.
"What does it mean that Haruhisa Furuya is a ****stial messenger?
This is the result of Nagisa's psychic vision that she spoke out during the decapitation trial and turned the trial, which was almost overturned by her imprisonment, on its head.
This was completely out of Kaede's expectation as well.
"That's exactly what I meant.
Nagisa said, not even hiding her ****yance at Kaede's response.
"There was a definite hint of a celestial surrender coming from that guy. ……There was no one inside, though.
I'm sorry…….
Kaede felt a deep sense of relief when she heard Nagisa's words.
Was it because of the ****tural interruption of Nagisa's psychic vision, or did the priest's false seal dece*** Nagisa's psychic vision as well?
In any case, it seemed that Haruhisa was unaware of the presence of the voice that was said to be echoing in his head.
However, as relieved as she was, the results of Nagisa's psychic vision were too puzzling.
Nagisa assured him with certainty that Haruhisa Furuya was the desce**** of the heav**** beings.
It is a non-standard ability that allows a person to possess the inhabitants of the heavenly realm and temporarily exercise power beyond human comprehension.
It is an extraordinary ability that is…… still synonymous with rul*** in this day and age.
I'll ask you again, Kuzunoha. Is that kid Haruhisa Furuya really just a spirit disaster orphan?
Definitely.
Kaede answered immediately.
Since then, I had the people of Kuzunoha reexamine Haruhisa's origins, but the result was white. The result was white. He was completely just an ordinary bloodline.
Hence, I don't know.
Why did Haruhisa Furuya give me the feeling that he was bringing down the heavenly beings?
The thing that was supposed to be inside Haruhisa couldn't possibly be that sacred.
"……Damn. I'm not sure what to make of it.
Nagisa was still suspicious, but the auditing department was probably investigating at the level of DNA analysis. She easily backed down.
"Anyway. I'm pretty sure that kid is a bomb that can't be touched easily. ……The Shinzoku meetings are completely irregular. I'm not sure what to make of it. It's also a great way to get the most out of your business.
I'm sorry…….
I don't care about Kuzunoha's responsibility.
I wanted to say that to Nagisa, who gave me a look that said, "I'm glad you're happy," but Kaede kept a stern expression on her face so as not to reveal her heartfelt relief.
Does this mean that Haruhisa Furuya will be under greater scru**** than before in exchange for withholding his treatment?
"Of course not.
I'm not sure what to make of that. I'm not sure what to make of that.
Nagisa's eyes softened a little when I asked her about it with some personal feelings.
'Oh. That's okay.
"What?
He's too depressed to take a break, right?　So I thought it would be better to leave him with some light work. He's got a lot of talent. I don't want to ruin it by mishandling it. ……Well, I don't want the kid to fall in love with me any more than he already has.
I'm sorry…….
That's not good for us either.
Kaede's brow furrowed slightly as she thought of something out of place.
If the cherry blossoms were half-veiled guards, then the real ones had already been dispatched separately.
Haruhisa Furuya was an *****istic person. I was about to make arrang****** for my next meeting with him when I realized that…… it might be a good idea to give him a warning.
"Just to be clear, you can't tell anyone about what I just told you. Of course, I can't share this information with Haruhisa Furuya himself.
For a moment, I thought he had read my inner thoughts, but that was not the case.
I'm talking about the descent of the celestial beings and the ninth sexual relic.
It's an irregularity among irregularities. I'm not sure what to do with it. ……You're right.
Nagisa looked at Kaede with a mean look in her eyes, the opposite of the look she gave to her own apprentice.
I'm sure you'll be able to find out more about it.
I'm sure ……it's the same around Misaki Soya.
The sexual relic of the Succubus King. If you know the nature of that ***gile thing, anyone would do it.
"Well, yes.
Nagisa nodded at Kaede's words and quickly disappeared as if her business was done.
"……Huh.
In the corner of the hallway, where ***ence had fallen once again, Kaede sip*** her ***ned coffee and exhaled slowly.
Haruhisa Furuya's safety was now assured, albeit on a limited basis.
However, there were so many things that Kaede herself had not expected that she could not be honestly relieved.
Brin**** down the celestial beings. The demon tribe raids. On hold until…… the next Shinzoku meeting.
It was a lot of work for a mind exhausted by one-on-one intera****** with Nagisa to handle.
"For ……now.
With an exhausted mind, Kaede made up her mind.
"Maybe I'll go see Mr. Furuya again.
It was, of course, in the form of Mei.
End of last fiscal year. Ever since I was rescued by accident when I was in that state, I've been trying to stop before I'm found out. But still, I just can't stop.
"Take it easy this time.……
The reverse knee pillow was just barely okay.
Next time……, how about a rela**** stroll in the park, hand in hand?
****ming of things she could never do in her true form, Kaede surrendered herself to a moment of rest.
